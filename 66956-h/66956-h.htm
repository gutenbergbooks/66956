<small>OVERBOARD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;HELP! Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a girl&#8217;s voice, clear and sharp with
distress. The cry echoed over Loon Pond, and
rang through the woods which surrounded its
dimpled waters.</p>

<p>In a small, flat-bottomed boat, about fifty yards
from the shore, crouched a young girl of perhaps
sixteen years, her face blanched with terror as she
gazed into the depths beneath and uttered again
and again that piercing cry:</p>

<p>&#8220;Help! O quick, quick! Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Something dark rose slowly to the surface of
the pond, and a small white hand waved frantically
in the air a moment, then sank, struggling,
out of sight. Again it came up, this time more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
quietly, and again disappeared, while the occupant
of the boat screamed louder, her voice breaking
into sobs. The only oar to be seen was floating
quietly on the water, almost within reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help!&#8221;</p>

<p>Would no one come? The birches that crowned
the hill-top close by shivered in the sunlight; on
the farther shore, the pines stood motionless in
dark, silent ranks.</p>

<p>Just as the object in the water rose for the third
and last time, scarcely breaking the surface, the
bushes hiding the nearest bank suddenly parted,
and a boy dashed out into the pond which was
shallow at this point, with a smooth, sandy beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, Kittie, I&#8217;m coming!&#8221; he shouted
lustily, splashing ahead with all his might, and
making the water fly in every direction.</p>

<p>Presently he sank deeper, and began to swim
with such powerful strokes that half a dozen of
them brought him nearly alongside the boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, there, Randolph!&#8221; screamed Kittie
Percival, pointing to the sinking form.</p>

<p>Randolph gave one look, doubled over in the
water, and with a desperate effort dived headlong
in a line to cut off the drowning girl before she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
reached the bottom. After a few seconds which
to Kittie seemed days, he reappeared, holding his
helpless burden, and clutched the stern of the
boat. The poor girl&#8217;s head lay back on his shoulder,
white, cold, and motionless.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t&mdash;you&mdash;got&mdash;an oar?&#8221; puffed Randolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;It fell out when I wasn&#8217;t noticing,&#8221; sobbed
Kittie, &#8220;and floated off. We both leaned over to
reach it, and Pet fell into the pond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll swim for it. Here goes.&#8221; And
allowing his feet to rise behind him, with one arm
around the girl and the other hand still grasping
the boat, he struck out, frog-fashion, for the shore.
Presently he resumed his upright position, but
found the water was still over his head. A dozen
more pushes, and the second experiment was successful.
He announced that he felt bottom under
his feet, and presently the bow of the boat grated
on the sand. Kittie now jumped into the water
beside him, regardless of skirts and boots, and
assisted him in raising the unconscious girl, from
whose garments and long, bright hair the water
streamed as they lifted her tenderly in their
arms, and carried her to the shore.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>While they were thus engaged, a third actor
appeared on the scene, no other than &#8220;Captain
Bess&#8221; Percival herself, whom, with her sister Kittie,
the readers of <i>Pine Cones</i> will remember.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Kittie, Kittie, what has happened? Did she
fall overboard? Is she alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know,&#8221; panted Randolph, answering
her last question. &#8220;She was just going down the
third time. Where shall we take her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Up to the Indians&#8217; tent,&#8221; said Bess. &#8220;It&#8217;s
only a few steps from here. I left Tom and Ruel
there, while I came to look for you. Here, let me
help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring her lilies,&#8221; added Kittie sadly. &#8220;Poor
little Pet, she had only gathered two!&#8221;</p>

<p>The mournful procession took up its march
through the woods, Bess and Randolph carrying
Pet between them. Kittie followed, with the lilies,
helping when she could.</p>

<p>Pet Sibley was a girl slightly younger than her
companions, who lived near the Percivals in Boston.
When the invitation came from uncle Will
Percival in June for them to spend their summer
vacation, or a part of it, with him and aunt Puss&mdash;as
the children called his wife&mdash;at The Pines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
the girls begged permission, which was heartily
granted, to bring their friend Pet with them. She
was a frank, good-hearted girl, with light, rippling
hair, blue eyes, and a sunny disposition which
always looked on the bright side of everything and
perhaps was a bit too forgetful of the earnest in
life. If that, and her evident pleasure in her own
pretty face, were faults, they were very forgivable
ones; for she was sweet and true at heart, after
all. The fun of the whole thing was, that she had
never lived in the country. She was a thoroughly
city-bred girl; had travelled in Europe when she
was a wee child, had lived two or three years in
hotels and &#8220;apartments,&#8221; and knew absolutely
nothing of field and forest. A more complete
contrast to sober, thoughtful Kittie, and energetic
&#8220;Captain Bess,&#8221; could hardly be imagined. So it
came about that, as often happens with people of
widely varying dispositions, all three loved one
another dearly.</p>

<p>Randolph was in the second class at the Boston
Latin School, and had won three prizes that spring,
two for scholarship, and one for drilling.</p>

<p>On this particular morning Ruel, a guide, trapper,
and man-of-all-work at Mr. Percival&#8217;s farm in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the heart of the Maine woods, had taken the young
folks off for a tramp to Loon Pond, a pretty sheet
of water some four miles long by one and a half
broad. They had enjoyed themselves immensely&mdash;Randolph,
Tom, and the three girls&mdash;running
races along the forest paths, gathering mosses,
ferns and queer white &#8220;Indian pipes,&#8221; or listening
to Ruel&#8217;s quaint sayings as he talked of birds
and wild creatures of the wood, with not a little
philosophy thrown in.</p>

<p>At the distance of about a furlong from the
pond, they had come out upon a little clearing, on
the further edge of which was a rude tent of canvas.
In the doorway sat an Indian squaw, with
one tiny brown pappoose in her arms, and another
playing on the grass near by. The father of the
babies she said, on inquiry, was off somewhere in
the woods. She had a few baskets for sale, and
while Bess and the two boys stopped to look at
these and play with the babies, Kittie and Pet had
run on ahead, and having reached the shore of the
pond, had come upon an old boat, apparently used
for a long time past by no one, except perhaps the
Indian when he was not too lazy to fish. Into this
boat they had climbed, screaming and laughing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
girl-fashion, and hastily pushing it off with the one
oar which lay in the bottom, had been trying to
collect a bunch of lilies to surprise the rest, when
the accident happened as Kittie described it.</p>

<p>It took but a few minutes for the mournful little
group to reach the camp, though the distance
seemed miles. Pet showed not the slightest sign
of life and her pretty hair almost touched the
ground as it hung over Randolph&#8217;s shoulder and
swayed to and fro as he walked.</p>

<p>Ruel&#8217;s quick eye was the first to catch sight of
them, and to take in the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring her here,&#8221; he said sharply, springing to
his feet and wasting no time in questions. &#8220;Now
turn her on her face&mdash;so&mdash;there, that&#8217;ll do. Poor
little gal! I dunno whether we c&#8217;n bring her to,
but we c&#8217;n try, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I run for the doctor, Ruel?&#8221; asked Tom,
trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;No doctor nearer&#8217;n six mile,&#8221; said the guide
grimly. &#8220;By the time he&#8217;d git here we shouldn&#8217;t
need him, either ways. Bess, you&#8217;n&#8217; Kittie take
her inside the tent&mdash;here, let me lift her&mdash;git
her wet clothes off an&#8217; roll her in blankets. Grab
&#8217;em up anywhere you c&#8217;n find &#8217;em. I&#8217;ll fix it with
the Injuns. Randolph, you&#8217;re wet&#8217;s a mink yourself.
Take Tom with you and run fer home. Mis&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Percival will give ye some hot tea and put ye to
bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what shall I do, Ruel?&#8221; asked Tom again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You git a couple of them big gray shawls of
your aunt&#8217;s an&#8217; bring &#8217;em in the double team to
the back road, where this path comes out&mdash;remember
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Ruel, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Git Tim to put the horses in, and drive. He&#8217;ll
hurry &#8217;nuff, once git him goin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom and Randolph were off like a flash, and
Ruel turned to the squaw, who had been standing
motionless, after having picked up her pappoose
that Ruel had tipped over when he jumped up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Moll, can&#8217;t ye take holt and help the gals
a little?&#8221;</p>

<p>The squaw came forward crossly enough, mumbling
and grumbling to herself, and, entering the
tent, pulled the flap down behind her. Once
inside, she worked harder than any of them, with
hands as gentle and skilful as those of a hospital
nurse.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes passed. It was a hot day in
late June, and Ruel wiped his brow repeatedly as
he paced to and fro before the tent. The Indian,
he knew, would bear no interference, and her
knowledge and experience were invaluable.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_014fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;SHE HAD ONE PAPPOOSE IN HER ARMS.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>&#8220;Any signs of life?&#8221; he asked aloud, when he
could bear the suspense no longer.</p>

<p>Kittie put a white face out between the hangings,
and said &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Twenty minutes. A thrush from a thicket near
by, sang a few notes, and stopped. The air went
up in little waves of heat, from the tree-tops. It
was very still.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an exclamation inside the
tent; both girls cried out at once, and were hushed
by the guttural tones of the Indian.</p>

<p>Another long silence, almost unendurable to the
big-hearted man outside, who felt in some way
accountable for what had happened.</p>

<p>He hid his face in his hands, and walked slowly
off toward the thicket where the thrush had sung.</p>

<p>Again there was a stir within the tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; cried Bess joyfully. &#8220;She moved her
eyelids! She&#8217;s alive! She&#8217;s alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon a new voice was heard behind the canvas&mdash;a
low, troubled moan, then a pitiful crying, like
that of a beaten child. Poor little Pet, it was
hard, coming back to life again! She writhed in
agony for a few minutes, crying and catching
her breath brokenly. But at last her sweet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
blue eyes opened. &#8220;Mamma!&#8221; she said, with
trembling lips, looking about wonderingly at her
strange surroundings.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Pet, darling, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; sobbed Kittie,
falling on her knees and kissing the pale face
again and again. &#8220;You&#8217;re all safe and alive! It
was my fault, taking you out&mdash;of course you
thought it was like the Public Gardens&mdash;oh, dear,
and here are your two lilies!&#8221; And Kittie burst
out crying afresh at sight of them.</p>

<p>While she had been talking, Pet had gazed at
her and the dark face of the Indian alternately.
Slowly came back the memory of the walk in the
woods, the first view of the shining lake, the laughing
scramble into the boat, the fair lily faces, looking
up at her. Then, the terrible moment when
she felt herself falling down, down, with all the
world flying away from her, and only the
thick, green, stifling water pressing against her
face.</p>

<p>She tried to put up her little hands to shut out
the picture, but she was too tightly rolled in the
blanket. Then she looked up and&mdash;laughed!
At the same moment the Indian threw back the
tent-flap, and beckoned to Ruel, who was hurrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
toward her at the sound of the voices. Pet lay
swathed in cloths and blankets of all colors, as old
Moll had snatched them from bed and floor, so that
up to her chin she looked like a gay-colored little
mummy. Her head, with its long golden hair,
rested in Bessie&#8217;s lap; and a smile was on her
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; exclaimed Ruel, taking off his
woodsman&#8217;s cap. Then he dropped into his old-fashioned,
easy drawl once more, and commenced
active preparations for the homeward trip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;think I&mdash;can&mdash;walk&mdash;&#8221; whispered Pet
faintly, wriggling a little in her cocoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, I&#8217;ve no doubt you c&#8217;d fly, ef we&#8217;d let ye,&#8221;
remarked the guide, busying himself in wringing
out her wet clothes and rolling them into a bundle;
&#8220;but I guess we&#8217;ll hev the fun of carryin&#8217; of ye,
this time. Tom&#8217;ll be back soon&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here he comes, now!&#8221; interrupted Bess, as the
boy hurried forward with his arms full of shawls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she&mdash;is she&mdash;?&#8221; he stammered, halting a
few paces distant.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all right, my boy,&#8221; said Ruel kindly.
&#8220;She&#8217;s ben a laughin&#8217;, and is all high fer walkin&#8217;
home, ef we&#8217;d let her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>The boy&#8217;s face twitched with emotion, and in
spite of himself he could not prevent two or three
tears from rolling over his cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s some cordial,&#8221; he managed to say,
&#8220;that aunt Puss said would&mdash;would be good for
her. And uncle Will himself was at home, and
will meet us at the cross-road with his team.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before leaving the tent, Ruel, at Tom&#8217;s request,
tried to make Moll accept a small sum for her services.
But she would not take a cent.</p>

<p>&#8220;These Injuns are queer people,&#8221; said Ruel,
leading the way with Pet in his arms, toward the
road. &#8220;Sometimes they do act like angels from
heaven, an&#8217; sometimes&mdash;they don&#8217;t! You never
know whar to hev &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where does this family come from?&#8221; asked
Tom, trudging beside Ruel and holding twigs
aside from Pet&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;From up North somewhars. They won&#8217;t tell
who they are, and I shall be glad, fer one, when
they leave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be thankful to them as long as I live,
for what that woman did for Pet,&#8221; said Kittie
warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wall, that&#8217;s so; she was a master hand, an&#8217;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
no mistake. Give me an Injun fer any kind of a
hurt you kin git in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Right glad were they all to find uncle Will and
his noble grays, waiting for them at the road. Just
what the kind old man had suffered, sitting there
helplessly for the last five minutes, no one will ever
know&mdash;except perhaps his gentle wife Eunice&mdash;&#8220;aunt
Puss&#8221;&mdash;with whom he talked the whole
matter over, after the children had gone to bed
that night.</p>

<p>In a moment he had Pet in his trembling arms,
and with Ruel at the reins they were all soon comfortably
disposed in the big wagon, and rattling
homeward.</p>

<p>How they drove up to the door of the farm-house,
with Pet waving her slender white hand feebly,
between Bess and Kittie; how aunt Puss, strong
woman as she was, broke down utterly at sight of
her, and afterward hugged her, and cried over her,
and &#8220;cosseted&#8221; her, the rest of that memorable
day, need not be described. Enough to say that
Pet steadily regained her strength, and by night
was able to sit with the rest under the broad elms
before the house and listen to uncle Percival&#8217;s
stories.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>It was not until bedtime that as the girls were
going slowly up-stairs, arm in arm, she stopped
suddenly, and exclaimed &#8220;My watch!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your watch?&#8221; echoed the others. &#8220;Why,
what&#8217;s the matter with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wore it to the pond this morning. It was
that lovely little watch that mamma gave me last
Christmas, gold and blue enamel, with my name in
it. There was a chain, too, and a tiny key. Oh,
dear, what shall I do! Where can it be? It
couldn&#8217;t have fallen out, for &#8217;twas hooked into my
button-hole, just as tight!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you what&#8217;s become of your watch,
Pet,&#8221; exclaimed Randolph, from the hall below.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Indians!&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II.<br />


<small>WHERE IS THE WATCH?</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &#8217;M afraid,&#8221; said Mr. Percival at breakfast next
morning, &#8220;that your watch will not be recovered,
Pet. I sent Ruel over to the pond two hours
ago, and he reports that the Indians are gone, bag
and baggage. They generally stay only a few
weeks at a time in any one spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I saw a queer look in old Moll&#8217;s face
when we left,&#8221; put in Ruel, joining the conversation
with a down-East &#8220;hired-man&#8217;s&#8221; freedom.
&#8220;You know she wouldn&#8217;t take any money, which,
with an Injun, is &#8217;nuff to make you suspect somethin&#8217;s
up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom was sleeping late, and had not come down
to breakfast. At The Pines, one of the comforts
was that you could sleep just as long as you
wanted to in the morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re growing young things,&#8221; aunt Puss
would say, &#8220;and they have to get up early all winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
to get ready for school. It&#8217;s a pity if they
can&#8217;t lie abed here, so long&#8217;s they&#8217;re resting, till
afternoon, if they like.&#8221;</p>

<p>The real fact was that ordinarily the days were
so filled with good times that nobody wished to
lose an hour in the morning, and so all hands were
up bright and early.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you think the watch was worth,
Pet?&#8221; asked her aunt. &#8220;Bessie, let me give you
another mug of milk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pet sat next to aunt Puss, looking very pale and
quiet this morning. It was observed that she
started nervously every time she was addressed;
but this remnant of yesterday&#8217;s fright wore off
during the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but I
think mamma paid six hundred francs for it in
Geneva last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about one hundred and twenty dollars,&#8221;
said Mr. Percival. &#8220;It would be worth at least a
hundred and fifty in America, when it was new.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t it have dropped out of her pocket?&#8221;
suggested Kittie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruel searched every foot of ground where you
went.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;Why can&#8217;t the thieves be pursued?&#8221; exclaimed
Randolph, starting to his feet. &#8220;I&#8217;ll join a party,
for one, to overtake them and recover the property!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down and finish your coffee, my boy,&#8221; said
his uncle, smiling. &#8220;The sheriff and two assistants
started on their track half an hour ago. But
I fear it won&#8217;t be of much use, as they are too
cunning to be easily caught. Of course they will
deny all knowledge of the watch, probably having
hidden it when they heard the officers coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will they be arrested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls began to look frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;And where will they be brought, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here. I am a Trial Justice in this county,&#8221;
said Mr. Percival, rising.</p>

<p>Just then Tom entered the room, looking as if
he had not slept very soundly, after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle,&#8221; he said in a low voice, glancing at the
rest as they left their places at the table with a
clatter of chairs on the kitchen floor, &#8220;uncle,
can I see you alone for a moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Percival patted him on the shoulder. &#8220;Better
eat your breakfast, my boy, the first thing you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
do. I have some matters to look after in the barn
and you can find me there, if you want to. You
must forget about the accident yesterday,&#8221; he
added kindly, seeing the boy&#8217;s pale face. &#8220;Pet&#8217;s
all right now, and we sha&#8217;n&#8217;t let her fall in again,
you may be sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, sir, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here aunt Puss bustled up with a plate of
hot flapjacks, and uncle Will stepped aside with a
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat &#8217;em while they&#8217;re hot, Tom,&#8221; said Ruel
gravely, pausing a minute at the door, &#8220;or Mis&#8217;
Percival will have her feelin&#8217;s awfully hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Tom was fain to put off his interview with
his uncle, till some better season. Ah, Tom, if
you had but spoken a moment earlier, or insisted
one whit more strongly! But Mr. Percival went
off where his duties called him, and Tom found no
chance to see him alone that day, nor the next.
Whatever the subject was, it did not seem to disturb
him so much after a good breakfast; and he
promised himself he would attend to it a little
later.</p>

<p>The forenoon was spent quietly in the barn, in
the capacious bays of which the mounds of fragrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
hay had just been stored, still warm with the
midsummer sunshine, and furnishing an occasional
sleepy grasshopper, by no means startled out of
his dignity by his sudden change of residence.
The west wind blew softly in at the open doors,
through which one could look, as one lay on the
mow, into the sunny world outside, and catch a
few bars of an oriole&#8217;s call, or of robin&#8217;s cheery
note. The cattle were all out to pasture. Over
the floor walked the hens, in serene meditation,
placidly clucking, or uttering a remonstrative and
warning &#8220;Wha-a-a-t!&#8221; as a swallow careened too
near them in the bars of dusty sunlight. The
only other noise was the occasional bird-twitter
from one of the dozen or more nests upon the
rafters overhead, and the tapping of bills on the
floor as the sober fowls now and then gleaned a
stray insect or bit of seed-food.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see,&#8221; said Tom lazily, gazing up toward
the ridge-pole, where a swallow was busily
engaged in feeding her clamorous family, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see what people ever want to live in the city for!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If people could spend their time on hay-mows,
half asleep, or&mdash;Ow!&mdash;tickling their sisters&#8217; ears
with straws!&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all girls do, anyway. A feller
might just&#8217;s well stretch out here as curl up on a
sofa and <i>crochet</i> all day!&#8221; Tom delivered this
remark with emphasis, expressive of his manly
disgust at all fancy-work in general, and &#8220;crochet&#8221;
under which head he classed every home industry
connected with worsted&mdash;in particular.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to see a &#8216;feller&#8217; do Kensington,&#8221;
remarked Bess calmly. &#8220;Seems to me I remember
one who wanted to knit on a spool, one time
when he was sick, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O let up, Bess; that don&#8217;t count?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;And after he had knit two inches and
dropped thirteen stitches, gave it up because &#8216;it
made his head tired!&#8217;&#8221; concluded Bess mercilessly.</p>

<p>When the laugh had subsided, and Bess had
emerged from the armful of dried clover and red-top
under which Tom had extinguished her, Kittie
spoke up, more soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I know what Tom means, and he isn&#8217;t
so far out of the way either. We do waste lots of
time now, really, don&#8217;t we, girls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So do boys,&#8221; said Bess, stoutly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; but boys have something hard and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
useful to do, &#8217;most every day,&#8221; persisted Kittie,
whom the five Justices of the Supreme Bench
couldn&#8217;t have diverted from her point. &#8220;Boys go
to school until they&#8217;re ready to work or enter college.
Then they never stop working, till they
die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tom solemnly, &#8220;that&#8217;s what uses
me up so; it&#8217;s just hard work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like it!&#8221; exclaimed Randolph, burying
Tom in his turn. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what it is,
girls,&#8221; he added, as he gave Tom a final shot,
&#8220;there&#8217;s a good deal in what Kittie says. But
work is good for us, anyway; and besides, when
we do get in a little play, betweenwhiles, we have
a glorious time, I can tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I know lots of boys, and young men too,&#8221;
put in Pet eagerly, &#8220;who just go to parties and
don&#8217;t work hard at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I don&#8217;t count those things <i>boys</i>,&#8221; said Kittie.
&#8220;They&#8217;re just dolls; and if there&#8217;s anything
I always despised, it&#8217;s boy-dolls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think girls could do, Kittie?&#8221;
asked Bess, &#8220;when they don&#8217;t have lessons to get,
I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think they could make useful things to give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
poor people,&#8221; answered Kittie, her gray eyes
sparkling with earnestness. &#8220;If we put the same
amount of time into making up nice, plain clothes
for poor people&mdash;special poor people, I mean,
that we could find out about, ourselves&mdash;that we
do into &#8216;crochet,&#8217; as Tom says&mdash;what a lot
of things we could make and give away in one
winter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never could bear to sew,&#8221; sighed Pet, surveying
her pretty, plump fingers. &#8220;It seems just old
ladies&#8217; work, pulling over rag-bags and &#8216;piecing&#8217;
together. It&#8217;s dreadful, trying to save.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It depends on what you do with the rags,&#8221;
said Randolph. &#8220;My grandmother had one of
those bags that she was always using out of, and
yet &#8217;twas always full of rags, just crammed, so you
couldn&#8217;t pull the puckers of the bag together at
the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ever did she make with them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mats and carpets, mostly. That is, she didn&#8217;t
make &#8217;em herself, but used to hire poor people to
make &#8217;em, after she&#8217;d showed them how. She&#8217;d
always arrange it so&#8217;s to help two at once. &#8216;It&#8217;s
better,&#8217; she used to say, &#8216;to feed two birds with
one crumb, than kill them with a stone.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>&#8220;Why, how did she do it?&#8221; queried practical
Bess, much interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;d find out through the city missionaries
generally, some woman that was awfully poor, and
she&#8217;d send for her and say, &#8216;I know a family down
in such a street that are very poor; they earn just
enough to live on&mdash;not enough to <i>walk</i> on, for
they haven&#8217;t any carpets on their bare floors, this
cold weather.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then she&#8217;d show the poor woman, the
first one, how to &#8216;pull&#8217; a rag mat, and would hire
her to make one, giving her enough rags from that
bag. When &#8217;twas done, she&#8217;d praise it up and
say how pretty &#8217;twas, &#8217;specially this row, or that
flower, and so on; and then pay her for the
work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did your grandmother give the first poor
woman&#8217;s carpet to the second poor woman?&#8221;
asked Pet, knitting her brows over the algebraic
difficulty of the problem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not herself. She sent it by the first poor
woman so&#8217;s to let her have the pleasure of giving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How lovely!&#8221; exclaimed Pet. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
have a rag-bag of my very own this winter&mdash;with
nothing but plush in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bess, &#8220;that won&#8217;t do; plush catches
dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s up in my hay-mow!&#8221; The voice was
deep and strong, but entirely pleasant, and so
nearly underneath them that the girls jumped.</p>

<p>&#8220;O uncle Will,&#8221; they all cried at once, &#8220;do come
up here&mdash;it&#8217;s just perfect&mdash;and tell us a story!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s &#8216;just perfect&#8217; already, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d
better come!&#8221; Nevertheless the good-natured old
man mounted the steep ladder, and was at once
allotted the breeziest and softest seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; he said, baring his head to the
gentle west wind, &#8220;this is comfortable. How
many times I&#8217;ve lain on the hay here, when I was
a boy, and dreamed what I would do&mdash;sometime!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never dreamed yourself such a dear uncle
as you are,&#8221; said Bess softly, stroking his hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you are trying to spoil me! What story
shall I tell, I wonder? It must be short, because I
may be called away at any moment. Let me see&mdash;how
would one of my younger day scrapes
do?&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_030fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">PET.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;Splendid! splendid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this wasn&#8217;t much of an adventure for
youngsters like you who travel about over the
country, a hundred miles a day. But to us, Fred
and me, it seemed a good deal at the time. Fred
always loved mountain-climbing. He went to
Europe while still a young man, and only last week
he sent me a paper containing an account of his
ascent of one of the loftiest among the Bernese
Alps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he the stout gentleman that we saw here
last summer, uncle, and who told us so much about
Switzerland?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same one, Kittie. &#8216;Frederic Cruden,
Esq., F. R. S.,&#8217; he is now. But in those days he
was just a slim, fun-loving boy, and the only
&#8216;Fellow&#8217; he was, was a very good fellow indeed.
Well, while we were both in our teens, our two
families made up a party and visited the White
Mountains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no railroad through the Notch
then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not! If one wished to see the
grandest localities of the White Mountains, he
must either foot it or ride over the rough roads in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
the big, jolting stage-coach which often carried
more outside than in, and occasionally tipped its
passengers out upon the moss-banks beside the
road. Bears, too, were more abundant than now,
and that&#8217;s saying considerable; for in many of
the little New Hampshire towns of Coos County,
farmers are to-day prevented from keeping sheep
by the inroads of Bruin, who loves a dainty shoulder
of mutton for supper only too well. I saw by
the papers recently that the selectmen of one
township during last year paid bounties on eleven
bears and two wolves!&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Tom uttered a series of ferocious growls,
but was covered with hay and sat upon by his
cousin until he promised to behave himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were stopping at the fine, new Profile
House,&#8221; continued Mr. Percival, &#8220;Fred and I,
with our fathers and mothers, as I said. Being of
nearly the same age, we were always planning some
sort of excursion together. One day we had
begged to be allowed to ascend Mount Lafayette,
a peak about twenty miles southwest of Mount
Washington, and only second to the latter in point
of interest. A guide-book which we had procured
told of a fine house on the summit, and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
would just stop there long enough to cool off after
our walk, before coming down by the &#8216;well-worn
bridle-path.&#8217; We were sturdy little fellows, and
though we had never yet accomplished such a feat
as the ascent of a five thousand-foot mountain, felt
quite equal to the task.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How old did you say you were, uncle?&#8221; asked
Randolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;About fourteen, but large of our age. We
started off at about two o&#8217;clock in the afternoon,
with many injunctions to be back by tea-time, and
on no account to linger by the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in the highest of spirits that we strode
away on the level road, up the valley, toward the
peak that lay so softly brown against the blue sky
just beyond. Before long we struck into the
bridle-path, which was exceedingly muddy near the
base, and became constantly more steep and slippery
as we ascended. Boy-like, we were quite
heedless of the lapse of time, and often stopped to
gather birch bark, climb after squirrels&#8217; nests, or
take a bite of the sandwiches we had stuffed into
our pockets at the last moment. The forest, I remember,
was singularly silent, no breeze among
the stiff tops of the hemlocks, no merry singing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
birds; only now and then the muffled gurgle of a
brook among the mossy stones beside the path, or
the single, plaintive whistle of a thrush, far away
on the mountain-side.</p>

<p>&#8220;When we had stopped for breath, about half-way
up, a descending horseback-party passed us. We
asked them about the house on the summit, but
they only laughed, and said it had good walls and
a high roof. This disturbed us a little, but we soon
forgot our apprehensions, and pressed forward.
Half a mile beyond this point, we came to that
strange, nameless pool of water, seeming half cloud,
half dream, hanging like a dew-drop on the slope
of the mountain. As we stamped our feet on the
moss which composed its banks, the whole surface
of the ground, for rods away, trembled as if with an
earthquake, and made us feel as if we were walking
in a nightmare. It occurred to us that it would
add to the glory of our exploit if we could catch
some dream-fish out of this strange, unreal pond
among the clouds; so we spent an hour or more in
useless angling in its clear depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then Fred looked up at the sky, and uttered an
exclamation. I followed his glance&mdash;and dropped
my pole. The sun was almost resting on the edge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of the mountains in the west, and it was plain that
it would be dark in less than an hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And all those bears!&#8221; murmured Pet, gazing
at the narrator with round eyes. &#8220;O, I should
think you <i>would</i> have been scared!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Percival smiled. &#8220;If I had been as old as I
am now, I should have said &#8216;Fred, we&#8217;re caught
this time by our own thoughtlessness. We can go
down in half or quarter of the time it took us to
climb up; and once on the main road in the valley,
we shall be all right.&#8217; But a boy of fourteen doesn&#8217;t
reason in that way. We were tired and hungry.
We thought of the welcome we should receive
from the people on the summit, and of the good
things they would doubtless have for supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Besides,&#8217; said Fred, &#8216;we must be nearly up
now. The trees don&#8217;t last much longer&mdash;they
aren&#8217;t higher than our heads here. It&#8217;ll be all
rocks pretty soon, and then we shall be right at
the top, just like Mt. Washington.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So we started up again, with, we afterward confessed
to each other, uncomfortable misgivings in
our breasts. It was really my fault, though, for I
was the older of the two, and ought to have known
better.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>&#8220;Well, in ten minutes the sun was out of sight
behind the hills, and I tell you, boys, the shadows
felt cold. It was like walking into a running brook
in the middle of a hot day, and we shivered and
buttoned our jackets tight around our throats as we
clambered along over the rocks, panting in the thin
air, and stopping for breath every few rods.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was tough work, especially as the wind began
to rise and dodge at us from behind great bowlders,
cutting like knives with its chilling breath. Darker
and darker it grew, so that we could hardly distinguish
the path, that was now a mere series of
scratches over the rocks. In vain we strained our
eyes for a friendly twinkle of light from the windows
ahead. All was still, silent, dark. I confess,
Pet, I thought of the bears, and halted half a dozen
times, with beating heart, at sight of some dark
rock that crouched behind the path. We were
just thinking, Fred and I, of curling up for shelter
under some overhanging ledge, and so spending
the night, when a queer object caught our eyes.
It was like a tree, stripped of every branch, and
standing grimly alone there in the rocky desert,
like a solitary Arab. A few steps more showed us
what it was, and, at the same time, the tremendous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
mistake we had made, from the very outset of our
plan, flashed upon us. It was clear that we were
at last standing upon the very tip-top of Mount
Lafayette, lifted in the air nearly a mile straight
up, above the level of our home by the sea-shore.
But alas, where was the inn, with its longed-for
fires, its well-spread table, its comfortable beds and
friendly hosts? The little weather-beaten flag-pole
(for such was our naked tree), stood stiffly
erect beside a blackened and crumbling stone wall,
which enclosed a small space partially floored with
charred boards, partially choked with rubbish that
had fallen in long ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Seems to me I remember something about its
being burned up once,&#8217; said Fred, faintly. &#8216;I
s&#8217;posed of course they built it again!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there were the openings, where windows
and door had been set, and which now looked out
into the dreary night like eyeless sockets.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no time to be lost. The air was
growing colder every moment, and the bitter wind
was driving up a huge bank of clouds from the
east. Although it was early in September, we
afterward learned that ice formed in many places
through the mountains that night. Such cases are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
by no means rare, and, indeed, in some of the
ravines and gorges of the White Mountain group,
snow and ice may be found the whole year round.</p>

<p>&#8220;Entering the roofless walls, and placing our
sandwiches in a small niche which probably had
once served for a cupboard, we set vigorously to
work, ripping up the pieces of boards that still
remained, and piling them in one corner where the
wall was highest. In five minutes we had a roaring
fire, by the light and warmth of which we constructed
a rude shelter in the form of a &#8216;lean-to,&#8217;
against the rocks, and crept under it to sup off our
scanty provisions, and reflect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you frightened, sir?&#8221; asked Tom slyly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose there was no great danger,
Tom, but to boys who had spent their lives in
comfortable homes, surrounded by care, and gentle,
watchful attentions from those they loved most, it
was a thrilling experience. There, alone on the
mountain-top, high in air, far above any trace of
vegetation save a few frightened Alpine flowers
that huddle together under the rocks for a few
weeks in summer, the darkness about them like a
shroud, the wind rising and moaning over the
bare ledges, and a storm creeping up through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
valleys to assault their fortress at any moment.
At last it came. Like a tornado, an icy blast
rushed upon us with a howl and a roar, blowing
our fire out in a moment while the red flames
leaped back to the glowing brands only to be
hurled off into the darkness again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;And the rain! In less time than it takes to tell
it, we were drenched to the skin, and pinched and
pulled by the fingers of the storm that were thrust
in through a hundred little crannies in our almost
useless shelter. The thunder crashed, the rain
rattled on the loose boards, the fire hissed feebly
and turned black in the face, and the night closed
in about us colder and drearier than ever. All we
could do was to lie still, and shiver, and hope for
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;A little after midnight the tempest abated, and,
tired, healthy boys as we were, we dropped into a
troubled sleep. At the first glimmer of daylight,
however, we stretched ourselves with groans and
moans, and crawled stiffly out into the open air. It
was bitter, bitter cold; so that I remember it was
a long while before I could manage my fingers
well enough to light a match.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did we do for kindling? Why, I forgot to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
say that when it first began to rain, I took out all
the birch bark I had gathered on my way up, and
tucked it under my shoulder; so that for the most
part the inner strips were pretty dry, and sputtered
cheerily when I touched them off. I believe
nothing ever did me so much good as that fire.
Under its influence, we were so much cheered that
we actually walked out to see the sunrise, which
was glorious.</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t take us long to descend that mountain,
I can tell you; and we reached the Profile
House in season to tell the whole story to the
family (who, in truth, had slept little more than we)
over the breakfast-table.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as the story was completed, a rattle of
wheels was heard in the driveway leading to the
house. Presently a wagon drove up, containing&mdash;besides
a short, thick-set man whom Randolph
recognized as the sheriff, and the two young fellows
who served as deputies&mdash;an Indian half
covered in a blanket, a squaw, and two dignified
brown pappooses. It was easy to recognize them
as the Loon Pond campers.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br />


<small>THE TRIAL.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was decided to give the Indians their dinner
before examining them. Mr. Percival knew
they would be more likely to tell the truth if well-treated;
and all he wanted was to obtain the watch,
not to punish the thieves. Accordingly they were
conducted to the kitchen, and there, under charge
of the sheriffs, they were provided with a bountiful
meal by aunt Puss.</p>

<p>The captors meanwhile explained that they had
found their prisoners encamped about ten miles
down the road. They had been very angry at
first, but the sheriff, who was really a good-natured
farmer living about three miles from Mr. Percival&#8217;s
place, had managed to pacify Sebattis, the father
of the family, and he kept Moll in good order.
They all, added Mr. Blake, the sheriff, had denied
any knowledge of the watch, from first to last.</p>

<p>After dinner, to which the Indians did ample<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
justice, the whole party were conducted to the
sitting-room. Mr. Percival took his seat beside a
table, at one end of the room, and asked Sebattis
to hold up his right hand. He then administered
the oath to the prisoner with a dignity and solemnity
which impressed the young people, and which
were specially admired by Randolph, who had several
times seen the ceremony flippantly performed
in the city courts.</p>

<p>The magistrate now proceeded with the examination.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name, sir?&#8221; he asked gravely
but pleasantly.</p>

<p>The Indian, gratified by the title given him,
answered with promptness: &#8220;Sebattis Megone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is your wife with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yis. She Moll Megone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where have you been camping for the last
month?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sebattis hesitated a moment, then glanced at
his wife and replied, &#8220;Tent down by Loon Pond.
No good. Bad place. Me leave him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the matter with the place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No fish. Water bad drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you go away before?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Again the Indian paused, scowled slightly, and
threw his blanket across his shoulder with a gesture
not without dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me go when like; stay when like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Moll gave a sharp look at her husband,
which Randolph was just in time to catch. Seeing
that her glance was noticed, she made the best of
it and spoke up boldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We go sell baskit,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Plenty folk in
big town to buy &#8217;em&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; interrupted Mr. Percival.
&#8220;You shall tell your story in a moment. Eunice,
you give this woman a comfortable place in the
kitchen with her babies, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Indians seemed inclined to resent this
move, but the magistrate was evidently not a man
to be trifled with, and Moll sullenly withdrew,
bearing a pappoose on each arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; continued Mr. Percival once more,
&#8220;did you, Sebattis, see any of these young people
yesterday?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Me hunt on furder side Loon Pond.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did your wife tell you about it when you came
back to the tent at night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When me come wigwam, Moll say girl-with-gold-hair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
fall in pond, come near drown. Ver&#8217;
hard make alive ag&#8217;in. That all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t she show you something she had
found?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yis.&#8221; And the Indian gravely held up his
hand, making a circle with his thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children leaned forward expectantly, Pet&#8217;s
eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>The Indian never showed by the movement of
a muscle nor a glance of the eye the irony with
which he had purposely led his questioners to this
point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Half dollar,&#8221; he replied, in his slow, guttural
tones. &#8220;Moll find it where white hunter, <i>that</i>
man,&#8221; indicating Ruel, who was standing near,
&#8220;drop it in bushes when he go pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>All turned and looked at Ruel, who flushed to
his hair, but stood his ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know he prayed?&#8221; asked Mr.
Percival gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wife find where he two knees go down on moss.
Half dollar drop out. Wife say no keep. I say
yis, keep him for work an&#8217; wet blankit.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>Mr. Percival smiled in spite of himself at the
man&#8217;s confession; nevertheless he looked troubled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to tell me, Sebattis,&#8221; he said
sternly, after a moment, &#8220;that you have never seen
this girl&#8217;s watch? If half a dollar fell out of a
pocket, so could a watch. Come, my man, own up
and give it back, and I&#8217;ll let you go this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian&#8217;s brow darkened, and he drew himself
up to his full height.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sebattis no see watch. Know nothing &#8217;bout
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He delivered himself of this remark with more
emphasis than he had yet used; then sat down,
pulling his blanket around him; and not another
word would he speak, save a few guttural sentences
in his own language to his wife, who was now called
in once more. The scowl remained on his forehead,
and Kittie whispered to Bess that she saw
him eying the windows and their fastenings.</p>

<p>Moll was now sharply questioned, but with no
better result. She had seen the gold watch-chain,
she admitted, when the girls first reached the tent.
It was dangling from <i>her</i> pocket&mdash;pointing to
Kittie!</p>

<p>&#8220;O,&#8221; cried Kittie, &#8220;but that&#8217;s impossible, for I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
haven&#8217;t any watch nor chain myself, and I never
even touched Pet&#8217;s but once, and that was the day
we all got here and she was showing it to aunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Percival looked grave; the sheriff shut one
eye knowingly; the girls edged off, half-scared,
after Kittie had spoken. Moll alone appeared to
retain her perfect self-possession.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was in that one&#8217;s pocket,&#8221; she persisted,
using much better English than her husband. &#8220;I
was &#8217;fraid pappooses grab it, and break. Maybe
she take it,&#8221; she added, with a malicious look at
poor Kittie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; said uncle Will sternly. &#8220;Answer
my questions, and nothing more. When did you
say you saw this chain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When gal first come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not after they returned from the pond?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Forget all about it. Too much drown,&#8221;
said the squaw grimly. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t see him no more.&#8221;
And no other answer nor admission could be obtained.</p>

<p>Ruel, Randolph and the girls were now asked a
few questions each, to bring out their story in the
hearing of the Indians. The latter denied nothing,
and admitted nothing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>Mr. Percival looked perplexed. To him the
guilt of the Indians seemed plain, especially after
the palpable falsehood of the squaw. Nothing
could have been easier, in the excitement of the
restoration of the half-drowned girl, than to draw
the watch from her cast-off clothes, and conceal it.
The ground over which the party had passed had
been scrutinized inch by inch, as well as the
smooth, hard bottom of the lake where the accident
had occurred; and by eyes that were as sharp as
those of the Indians themselves. When Ruel said
quietly after his morning search, that the watch
was not in the woods nor the lake, that possibility
was dropped, as settled beyond doubt. There had
not been much ground to examine, for Pet distinctly
remembered, and in this she was corroborated
by Randolph, that she had taken out her
watch and named the time of day, just before they
first reached the wigwam.</p>

<p>Still, the magistrate could not commit the prisoners
without some shadow of real proof; and he
was obliged to admit to himself that there was
none whatever. He called Mr. Blake aside, and
held a consultation with him in low tones. The
attention of the others was for the moment taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
up with the pappooses, who were indulging themselves
in various grunts and gasps and queer
noises, accompanied by energetic struggles as if
they were attacked by some internal foe, such as
occasionally invades babyland. Moll sat holding
them, sullen and silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a pin&mdash;&#8221; began aunt Puss, with a
sympathetic movement toward the baby whose
uncouth wails were the wildest; but she did not
finish her sentence. A crashing of glass close at
hand startled everybody in the room; and one
glance at the shattered window-sash told the whole
story. Sebattis, watching his opportunity, and
seeing both doors of the room blocked by his
persecutors, had sprung through the lower half
of the window, carrying glass and all before him,
and in an instant was out of sight in the forest.</p>

<p>The babies, strange to say, had become perfectly
quiet and no one having seen the quick gleam of
triumph in the squaw&#8217;s eyes, she was not suspected
of having been the cause of their previous outcries,
by various sly pinches under the blanket.</p>

<p>The officers of the law at once sprang toward
the door, but Mr. Percival checked them. &#8220;It&#8217;s
of no use,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only real misdemeanor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
that can be proved against the fellow is assault
and battery on my window,&#8221; he added, gazing ruefully
at the ragged edges of the glass. &#8220;It rather
relieves us, Blake, of the necessity of a decision
in the watch matter, for you might scour the woods
for a month without finding an Indian who wanted
to keep out of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope,&#8221; said the sheriff, &#8220;that he won&#8217;t
lay it up against us, round here. These chaps are
ugly enough to burn a barn, if no worse, for sheer
revenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Ruel whispered to Mr. Percival, who proceeded
to act at once upon what was evidently the
guide&#8217;s suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Moll,&#8221; he said to the squaw, who had watched
the faces of the men with hardly concealed eagerness,
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry your husband ran away, for
I should have let him go, anyway. Now these men
will carry you back to your tent. If you ever find
that watch,&#8221; he added meaningly, looking her full
in the eye, &#8220;bring it to me and you shall have
twenty dollars reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word the woman rose, and passing
out, seated herself once more in the wagon, which
drove off rapidly down the road in the direction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
of her wigwam. The trial was over, and the prisoners
discharged; but the vexed question still
remained, Where was the watch?</p>

<p>In the afternoon, while Ruel and Tim repaired
the broken window&mdash;for panes of glass, putty
and carpenter&#8217;s tools were always ready at hand
in the workshop&mdash;the boys walked over to the
pond and examined the path and its vicinity carefully
for themselves, and even took turns diving
to the bottom of the pond, in a vain search for the
missing article. Wherever it might be, it clearly
had been carried off by some human agency. Pet&#8217;s
father and mother were at this time stopping in a
large hotel near Boston, and had written for her
to come up for a day or two, as there were friends
visiting them from the West whom they were particularly
anxious for her to meet and help entertain.
She could return to Mr. Percival&#8217;s, her
mother wrote, by the middle of the following week.</p>

<p>With a sad heart, both at leaving her friends,
and because she felt she was abandoning all hope
of her watch, she started off early on the morning
after the trial, with Ruel as driver, for the Pineville
Station where she was to take the cars on a
Branch of the Maine Central Railroad, for Boston.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>All the young folks except Tom, who unexpectedly
declined to go, on the plea of a headache,
accompanied Pet to the station, telling her about
their &#8220;Camp Christmas&#8221; of the preceding winter,
and waving hats and handkerchiefs until the train
rounded a curve and crept out of sight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom languidly rose from his bed,
as soon as he heard the laughing wagon-load
drive away; went down to breakfast with a sulky
face and red eyes, as if he had been up late
the night before, or had been crying&mdash;and hardly
waiting to reply to his uncle&#8217;s cheery good-morning,
walked off with his hands in his pockets, in
the direction of Loon Pond. After an absence
of a couple of hours, he returned, looking tired
out, and passed the rest of the forenoon in the
barn, lying on the hay-mow with a book. But if
you had peeped over his shoulder, you would have
seen that the pages were upside-down, and that
now and then a tear rolled slowly over the boy&#8217;s
cheeks, while his lips twitched nervously. Tom
was evidently, on this bright June day, one of the
unhappiest of boys. What could have happened?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV.<br />


<small>FIRE!</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp; WONDER if they <i>are</i> so different!&#8221;
Pet Sibley found the summer hotel very
pleasant. She was fond of gayety and pretty
dresses and music; and of these she found a
plenty at the &#8220;Everglades.&#8221; The hotel was within
a half-hour&#8217;s ride of Boston, but was situated in
the very heart of a beautiful, shadowy grove of
pines, whose breath made the air sweet all through
the long hours of the languid summer day. If the
trees were more civilized and conventional in their
appearance than the wide-branching, free-tossing
pines in Uncle Percival&#8217;s upland pastures and
hundred-acre wood-lot, Pet was not yet enough
waked-up to know the difference; in fact, found it
rather nice to be able to stroll about the well-kept
grounds of the &#8220;Everglades,&#8221; without fear
of tearing her skirts in the underbrush, or losing
her way if she left the path. There was no underbrush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
here, and it was pretty much all path.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes&#8217; walk, and bordering the
grove on the further side, a river wound pleasantly
and peacefully through a bright strip of meadow-land.
On this river the Sibleys kept a boat, with
carpet and cushioned seats&mdash;not much like the
rough little affair which had tipped Pet over into
Loon Pond.</p>

<p>Life at the Everglades flowed softly and calmly,
like the river; and on the surface floated, like its
radiant lilies, the fair ladies, young and old, who
fanned and smiled and danced away the summer,
without a thought of the suffering thousands in the
hot city, fifteen miles away.</p>

<p>Without a thought? Yes, there were some who
thought, and who brought poor and ailing children
out to a Country Home near by; but these were
few.</p>

<p>Pet Sibley, I am glad to say, was one of those
who remembered the narrow streets of the North
End, and the swarms of ragged men, women and
children who panted, dog-like, on curbstone and
doorstep, along the foul streets as the sun went
down each night.</p>

<p>The people from the West, Pet learned, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
relatives, and though their views of life hardly
agreed with her own&mdash;if, indeed, she had any
views&mdash;she found the new-comers very pleasant.
On the third day after her return, her cousin Mark,
whose home was in Chicago, and with whom already,
in the free intimacy of hotel life, she felt
well acquainted, had taken her out on the river.</p>

<p>A half-hour had slipped by, during which her
cousin had instructed her how to sit safely in a
boat, and even how to row a little. Just as they
turned a bend in the stream and floated into a cove
where birches and wild grape-vines afforded a grateful
bit of shade, the girl stopped rowing, and looking
up at Mark, who sat indolently in the stern of
the boat, made the remark with which this chapter
began:</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if they are so&mdash;<i>different</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pet&#8217;s pretty young forehead had a puzzled little
wrinkle as she leaned forward, with the oar-blades
rippling through the water, and the muslin sleeves
falling back from her brown wrists.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Are</i> they so different, cousin Mark?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her companion gave an impatient twitch to his
straw hat.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_054fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE PIAZZA AT &#8220;THE EVERGLADES.&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;Why, of course! They are not like you, Pet.
They are ignorant and poor and&mdash;and not clean,
you know. They were born to it and they like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t seem right. I heard a lady on
the piazza this morning say something about &#8216;those
creatures&#8217; in such a way that I thought she was
speaking of rats or snakes. It turned out she
meant the convicts who attacked their keepers at
the prison last July.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pet spoke warmly, as she was apt to do when
she once took up a subject. If she was yet a gay
young creature, very fond of &#8220;good times,&#8221; and
ready for any sort of fun, she yet was one of those
girls with whom shallow young men at summer
hotels are rather shy of entering into conversation.
She was only fifteen, and one by one the terribly
real problems of the day were marshalling themselves
before her. She would not pass them by
with a gay laugh, after the prevailing mode of her
merry companions. She felt somehow that it belonged
to her to help the world and make it better,
as well as to the missionaries and other good people
upon whose shoulders we so willingly pack responsibilities.</p>

<p>For this childish enthusiasm she was smiled
on indulgently by her friends. Kitty and Bess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
knew the best there was in her, and loved her
for it.</p>

<p>Pet gave two or three quick strokes, and paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there any way to help these poor people,
Mark? It must be the way these people live and
are brought up that makes them so rough and bad.
Isn&#8217;t there any way to help them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None that amounts to much. Besides, that
isn&#8217;t our business. There are men enough who do
nothing else&mdash;are paid for it&mdash;missionaries and
the like. And you can&#8217;t make everybody rich, you
know. The Bible itself says, &#8216;Ye have the poor
always with you.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps that doesn&#8217;t mean that we ought to
have them,&#8221; replied Pet, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;re here, and we may as well make
the best of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is the best? That&#8217;s just it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use of your thinking about it?
You can&#8217;t do anything, and you don&#8217;t even know
the kind of people we&#8217;re talking of; the North-Enders,
for instance. You have never seen and
touched them; and if you should meet them face to
face, I don&#8217;t believe you would care for any further
acquaintance. They&#8217;re simply disgusting.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Pet said no more on the subject, and just as the
sun dropped into the arms of the waiting pines on
the hill they reached the little wharf on the river-bank,
moored the boat, and walked up to the hotel.
She went straight to her mother&#8217;s room, and, after
her fashion, as straight to the point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, I want to go into the city right away,
and spend the night with aunt Augusta.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my child, it&#8217;s tea-time already, and there&#8217;s
a hop this evening. You had better wait till morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, I so much want to go now. The train
leaves in fifteen minutes. I don&#8217;t care for the hop,
anyway; it&#8217;s too warm to dance. Please, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course impulsive little Pet had her way, and
was soon whirling along toward the city, with a
strong resolve in her mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll walk up to auntie&#8217;s from the depot, and to-morrow
I&#8217;ll go down to North Street with uncle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train stopped at all the small stations, and
was delayed by various causes, so that it was quite
dark when she started on her walk. She was glad,
after all, to find the streets well-lighted, and filled
with respectable-looking people.</p>

<p>On reaching Washington Street, however, everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
appeared weird and unnatural. The sidewalks
along which one could hardly pass in the
daytime, for the crowd, were nearly deserted. All
the spots that were bright by sunlight, were now
dark, and all the ordinarily dark places light. It
was exactly like the negative of a photograph, and
gave Pet a sense of looking on the wrong side of
everything. Once she saw something move behind
the broad plate-glass windows of a railroad agency,
on a corner that in the daytime was a business centre.
She approached, and was startled to find the
object a huge rat, trotting silently about, over the
polished engravings and placards, behind the glass,
a very spirit of solitude and evil. It was all like a
nightmare, and she began most heartily to wish
herself back at the Everglades, dancing the Lancers
with cousin Mark.</p>

<p>Coincidences happen; not in stories simply, but
in real life. The vessel is wrecked in sight of port;
the day the owner dies; the man we meet on the
steamboat at the headwaters of the Saguenay
River, has, unknown to us until then, ate, drank,
and slept in the next house all winter, within ten
feet of us; the dear friend we have known so long,
is at last discovered to be intimate with that other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
dear friend we love so well, and finally it comes out
that all three of us were born in the same little
town in New Hampshire.</p>

<p>Now the coincidence that happened on this particular
evening was as follows:</p>

<p>While Pet was making her way along Washington
Street in the dark, another girl about thirteen
years of age, named Bridget Flanagan, was standing
on the third gallery of the Crystal Palace, in
the same good city of Boston, looking down into
Lincoln Street. Like Pet, she was wondering
whether anything could be done to aid the poor.
Not that any such words passed through her mind.
Dear me, no! I doubt if she would have even
known what &#8220;aid&#8221; meant, that word being in her
mind associated solely with lemons of a shrivelled
and speckled character. If she had spoken her
thoughts, which she sometimes had a queer way
of doing, she might have said something like this:
&#8220;Don&#8217;t I wish I could git out o&#8217; this! An&#8217; the
rich folks wid all the money they wants, an&#8217; nothin&#8217;
to do but buy fans an&#8217; use &#8217;em up. My! ain&#8217;t it
hot?&#8221;</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> hot. There was a man playing on a bag-pipe
in the street below, and not only had a crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
of children and idlers surrounded him as he stood
before a brilliantly lighted (and licensed) liquor
store, but the long rickety galleries which run in
front of each floor in the &#8220;Palace&#8221; were full of
half-dressed, red-faced women and children, who
leaned on the dirty railing and listened to the
music, just as the guests at the &#8220;Everglades&#8221; at
the same time were listening to their orchestra of
a dozen pieces.</p>

<p>In the gallery overhead Bridget heard two women
dancing and shouting noisily. Somewhere in the
building a child was crying loudly in a different key
from the bag-pipe. Bridget didn&#8217;t notice these
things particularly; she was used to them. Only
there came over the young human girl-heart which
was beating beneath the rags and in the midst of
this wretchedness a sick longing for&mdash;what?
Bridget did not know.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the hot weather it is,&#8221; she said to herself;
&#8220;it&#8217;s usin&#8217; me up intirely. I&#8217;ll jist go an&#8217; have a
bit av a walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly she issued forth, shortly afterward,
with a broken-nosed pitcher in her hand, and made
her way to one of the shops across the street.
There were plenty to choose from&mdash;the city had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
looked out for that. Their licenses were as strong
as the Municipal Seal, stamped on one corner, with
its picture of church steeples and clouds, and
heavens above and pure, broad sea beneath, could
make them. Nearly every second house in the
street beckoned with flaring lights to its pile of
whiskey barrels and shining counters; the dark intervals
along the street, between these shops, were
the ruined homes of those who went in at the
lighted doors.</p>

<p>Opposite, the Crystal Palace, then at its filthiest
and worst, reared its ugly shape like a fat weed,
watered day and night by whiskey and gin.</p>

<p>[Within the last twelvemonth this building has
been torn down, and Lincoln Street largely reclaimed
from the squalor and wretchedness which
marked it on the evening of which I am speaking;
but within a stone&#8217;s throw of the same spot, the
same sights may be witnessed any night in the
week. The district is popularly known as the
&#8220;South Cove.&#8221;]</p>

<p>As Bridget pattered along the sidewalk with her
bare feet, a coarse-looking woman in front of her
threw something down on the bricks and laughed
hoarsely. The &#8220;something&#8221; resolved itself into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
a kitten, which picked itself up and walked painfully
over to a burly, broad-shouldered man who
was sitting on the steps of a basement alley, so
that his arms rested on the sidewalk. The kitten
curled up beside him. The man put out his big,
red hand and stroked it once, then went on with
his smoking. The kitten was purring and licking
its aching feet as Bridget, who had paused a moment
from some dull feeling of compassion, went
on her way.</p>

<p>Leaving her pitcher at the bar, with the injunction
that it should be filled and ready for her return,
she passed out of the store and walked slowly
down Lincoln Street toward the Albany Station.
The street was full of children running to and fro
with shouts and screams of laughter or pain; some
of them going in and out of the shops with pitchers
and mugs, some lying stupidly in the gutter. The
air was stifling, and as Bridget reached the corner
she saw the groups of belated people hurrying out
to the Newtons and Wellesley, where they might
cool themselves in the pure air, with whatever
means of comfort money could purchase.</p>

<p>Pet Sibley and Bridget Flanagan both reflected
upon this as they unconsciously drew nearer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
nearer together. Pet was tired, and was beginning
to look for a horse-car to take her to her aunt&#8217;s
house. The little Irish princess had turned and left
her &#8220;Palace&#8221; until she was now near the head of
Summer Street.</p>

<p>Ten steps further, and they met upon the corner,
with the great gilded eagle&#8217;s wings outstretched
above their heads. Both paused for a moment.
Pet was dressed as she had been in the boat&mdash;all
in white, with a pretty fluffy ostrich feather curving
around her broad straw hat, and a fleecy shawl
thrown over her shoulders. Bridget&#8217;s shawl was
not fleecy, and her dress was not white. Nor did
she wear lawn shoes.</p>

<p>What either would have said I do not know.
Perhaps nothing. Perhaps their lives, just touching
at this point, would have glided farther and
farther apart, until there was no room in this earth
for them to meet again. But at that moment
something happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look o&#8217; that!&#8221; cried Bridget.</p>

<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; cried Pet at the same moment; and
they both pointed to the third story of a high
granite block across the street. One of the windows
was slightly open, and through this narrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
space a delicate curl of blue smoke floated softly
out, laughed noiselessly to itself, and disappeared.
They could hardly have seen it at all, but for the
powerful electric light upon the corner. Another
puff of smoke, and another; then a steady stream,
growing blacker and larger every moment. A
faint glow, reflected from somewhere inside, shone
upon the window panes.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do?&#8221; cried Pet; &#8220;it&#8217;s all on
fire, and nobody knows!&#8221; Instinctively she looked
at Bridget for an answer. Somehow the difference
between herself and the ragged little Irish girl did
not seem so great just then.</p>

<p>The fire had broken out near the place where
the great fire of 1872 started. Each of the girls
could remember dimly that awful night of red skies
and glittering steeples. The massive blocks had
been rebuilt, business had rolled through the streets
once more, property of value untold lay piled away
in those great warehouses on every side, and only
these two slender, wide-eyed girls knew of that
ugly black smoke, with its gleaming tongues of
flame, gliding about over counter and shelf, as Pet
had seen the rat, a few minutes before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure we must give the alar-r-m,&#8221; said Bridget,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
hurriedly, gathering the faded shawl about her
neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know how. Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I? You jist come along wid me&mdash;run,
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>They almost flew down the street, dainty shoes
and bare brown feet side by side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the box,&#8221; panted Bridget, pausing suddenly
before an iron box attached to a telegraph
pole. &#8220;Can yer read where it says the key is?&#8221;</p>

<p>Pet read: &#8220;Key at Faxon&#8217;s Building, corner of
Bedford and Summer Streets.&#8221;</p>

<p>To reach the corner, rouse the watchman, snatch
the key from his sleepy hands, rush back again, and
whisk open the iron box was the work of two minutes.</p>

<p>Perfect silence everywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look a-here, now,&#8221; said Bridget, breathlessly,
standing on tiptoe. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen &#8217;em do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pulled the handle once, twice. Then they
waited, their hearts beating fiercely. They were
off the travelled ways, and no one passed by them.
All this time the smoke was creeping up the stairways
of the lofty building, and the red fire was
quietly devouring yard after yard of wood-work.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>Bridget raised her hand to pull the lever for the
third and last time&mdash;when they both started.</p>

<p>All over the broad, restless, wakeful city, the
heavy bells rang out, one following another like
echoes. Sick people turned wearily in their beds;
babies awoke to bewail their broken naps; men
and women stopped at the corners of streets to
count the number, and shook their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad place, down by Summer and Chauncey
Streets&mdash;let&#8217;s go!&#8221; said one to another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Two</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Three</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Four</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Five</span>&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">One</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Two</span>.</p>

<p>Miss Augusta Vernon consulted her fire-alarm
card, which always hung by the sitting-room mantel-piece;
then she went to the front window and
threw open the blinds. There was a faint flush on
the sky, like the coming dawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; exclaimed aunt Augusta. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
real fire. And this hot night, too! I do hope
they&#8217;ll have it out soon, poor fellows!&#8221;</p>

<p>As she took her seat by the window, and watched
the light growing broader and redder every moment,
her strong, kind features showed much more
anxiety than one would expect, considering that it
was not her store that was burning, nor her firemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
fighting the fire. But aunt Augusta, in the
city, had a curious way like that of aunt Puss up in
the Maine woods, of concerning herself with other
people&#8217;s troubles and trying to lighten them, with
loving-kindness or with money. As she had a
plentiful supply of both, her sympathy in such
cases was apt to be a substantial affair, really worth
counting upon&mdash;as many a poor creature, sick and
in prison, could testify.</p>

<p>As soon as the bells rang out, a great awe fell
upon the two girls. What mighty host of giants
had they roused from sleep, calling hoarsely to one
another over the housetops?</p>

<p>Pet drew closer to Bridget, and grasped her
hand. Even Bridget seemed dismayed at first, but
quickly recovering herself, she half pushed, half
drew Pet up a flight of high stone steps near by.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yer&#8217;ll git yer dress all kivered wid mud, if yer
don&#8217;t kape out o&#8217; the strate,&#8221; she said, as she turned
away. &#8220;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; ter stay down an&#8217; tell &#8217;em
where the fire is. It says so on them little cards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the crowd! When they come you will get
hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm! I&#8217;m used to worse crowds nor ever you
saw. There! I hear &#8217;em now!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>As Pet listened there rose a faint, far-off rattle of
wheels upon the pavement, mingled with a jangling
sound of gongs and horns.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the ingine!&#8221; cried Bridget, in great excitement.
&#8220;It&#8217;s comin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>But other things were coming too. Bridget had
taken her stand directly in front of the alarm-box,
and a stream of men and boys who poured around
the corner jostled her roughly and pushed her to and
fro.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&mdash;come quick!&#8221; called Pet, just able to
make herself heard above the noise of the crowd.
But Bridget shook her head, and pointed down the
street.</p>

<p>It was a grand sight&mdash;the engine, with its scarlet
wheels, and its polished stack sending out a long
trail of brilliant sparks like shooting stars, the two
powerful black horses tearing furiously over the
pavements, yet subject to the slightest word or
touch of their driver, who sat behind them firmly
braced against the foot-board, the reins taut as
steel, and the gong sounding beneath without
pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of the way here!&#8221; shouted a burly
policeman, forcing his way through the crowd.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>The men surged back, and nobody noticed the
little barefooted figure who was hurled violently
against the building. She uttered a faint cry, and
held up one foot, as a lame spaniel might do. A
young man with delicate clothes and a light cane,
who had stopped on his way to the station to &#8220;see
the fun,&#8221; had set his heavy boot on the little, shrinking
foot. She might have got out of the way more
quickly, but she <i>must</i> keep to the front to tell the
firemen.</p>

<p>The engine thundered up to the box and stopped,
hissing and smoking furiously. The black horses
quivered and pawed the pavement, shaking white
flecks of foam over their sleek bodies.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the fire?&#8221; called the driver sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blest if I know&mdash;&#8221; began one of the men addressed,
but he was interrupted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure it&#8217;s on Summer Street, sir, &#8217;most up to
Washington, on the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a surprisingly small, shrill voice for such
an important piece of information, but it sounded
reliable. The driver knew that every moment now
might mean the loss of thousands of dollars, and,
giving his horses the rein, was galloping off up the
street again, almost before Bridget&#8217;s words were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
out of her mouth. A few moments after, the panting
engine and the distant shouts of the firemen
told of the work they were doing.</p>

<p>Well, the block was saved. A few thousand dollars&#8217;
damage on goods fully insured was all. Next
morning the papers, being somewhat hard pressed
for news, gave &#8220;full particulars&#8221; of the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was fortunate,&#8221; said the eloquent reporter, in
closing his account, &#8220;that the fire was discovered
by some passer-by, who promptly pulled in an
alarm from box fifty-two. Five minutes later, and
the loss must have been almost incalculable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Full particulars?&#8221; Perhaps not quite full.</p>

<p>When the engine rattled away, with the crowd
after it, Pet had come timidly down the steps.
Bridget had been borne away by the crowd, and was
not to be found.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you?&#8221; she called. &#8220;I do not know
your name&mdash;oh-h!&#8221; She stopped with a pitiful
little cry.</p>

<p>Bridget was crouched in a miserable heap just
around the corner. She was stroking her bruised
foot with trembling hands, and crying softly to herself.
Somehow she felt like the kitten, only she
had no one to go to; and her head was so dizzy!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Then she looked up, and saw the white shawl
and the ostrich feather and Pet&#8217;s eyes. And once
more Pet forgot the difference.</p>

<p>A policeman found them there a few minutes
later. Pet had her arms around the faded shawl,
and Bridget&#8217;s tously little head was lying wearily
against her shoulder. The poor trampled foot was
bound up in somebody&#8217;s embroidered handkerchief.</p>

<p>Pet did not give the officer time to speak. She
was on her own ground now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you call a hack or a herdic, please?
This girl is sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tone was quiet, but plainly said it was
accustomed to giving directions, and having them
obeyed, too.</p>

<p>The policeman had approached with a rough joke
on his tongue&#8217;s end, but it turned into a respectful
&#8220;Yes&#8217;m, certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course they went straight to aunt Augusta,
who was still sitting by the window, and who was
so used to emergencies that she took the whole
affair quite as a matter of course.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told the Lord I&#8217;m not worth it,&#8221; she had
been heard to say, once, &#8220;but such as I am, I want
to help. So I&#8217;m always expecting Him to give me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
something of the sort, just as my father used to
let me hold the tacks when he was at work on
pictures or carpets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bridget was promptly put to bed and her foot
dressed by Miss Augusta&#8217;s own deft hands. Before
long she was fast asleep, which probably didn&#8217;t
make much difference with her state of mind, as
the whole scene, with Pet and the motherly woman
hovering about her, was the best kind of a dream.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pet told the story to her aunt; she
had learned from the Irish girl, on the way to the
house, that she had no father or mother living, but
made her home with a dissipated uncle and brother,
who took turns in the prisoner&#8217;s dock of the criminal
court; where, likely enough, Bridget would
have taken her own turn, before long.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I&#8217;m going to do,&#8221; said Miss
Augusta, decisively. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to send her up to
Mrs. Percival. When are you going back, Pet?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Day after to-morrow, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can take her along as well as not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But her family&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see Mr. Waldron&mdash;he&#8217;s the City Missionary&mdash;and
he&#8217;ll fix it all right. We&#8217;ve often arranged
matters like this.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;But do you suppose Mrs. Percival will take
her?&#8221; asked Pet rather doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see&#8217;s she can help it,&#8221; said Miss Augusta,
with a short laugh. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you fear. I
know &#8216;aunt Puss&#8217; better than you do, though I
never &#8217;ve seen her. Kittie and Bess told me all
about her, last spring.&#8221; So it came about that
when Pet took her seat in the Northern train, a few
days later, a neatly dressed little Irish girl sat beside
her, awed into silence by the furniture of the
car and, shortly afterward, by its rapid motion.</p>

<p>When the conductor came round for the tickets,
her hand furtively stole over and clutched a fold of
Pet&#8217;s rich dress, for protection from the man in
uniform. And Pet had to reassure her, and point
out interesting bits of landscape as they flew northward
toward The Pines, side by side.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br />


<small>IN THE DEN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AT The Pines, during Pet&#8217;s absence, the summer
days passed swiftly and joyously; joyously
at least for all but one of the party. Tom
was no longer the bright, merry, mischievous Tom
of old. He joined in the sports and rambles of the
others, it is true, but with a sober face and lagging
step quite unnatural for him; and he was often
away from the house, alone. As these strange
ways grew more marked, Randolph tried to get at
the source of the boy&#8217;s trouble. But Tom
shrugged his cousin&#8217;s arm off from his shoulders
where it had been affectionately laid, and told him
gruffly to &#8220;let a fellow alone&mdash;nothing was the
matter!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was almost time for Pet to return. The young
people had arranged to ride over to the railroad
and meet her, with Ruel and the big wagon. They
had received a letter from her, telling a little about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
her experience at the fire, and they were extremely
anxious to hear the whole story, and to see little
Bridget, the heroine of the occasion. Mr. Waldron,
with his great, kindly heart, had given Miss
Augusta all the aid she asked, and more; so there
was no obstacle in the way of Bridget&#8217;s coming,
unless it were aunt Puss. And the idea of aunt
Puss being an obstacle&mdash;!</p>

<p>On the day before, Kittie and the captain had
planned to go into the woods and gather oak leaves
for trimming, to decorate Pet&#8217;s room. What was
their dismay, on waking that morning, to hear the
rain pouring steadily on the shingles over their
heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we can&#8217;t get any leaves!&#8221; exclaimed Bess
sorrowfully, as she stood at the window, looking
out at the blurred landscape and the slanting lines
of rain between her and the wood-lot. &#8220;What ever
<i>shall</i> we do, all day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; laughed Kittie, giving her
sister&#8217;s long brown hair a toss up backward and
down over her eyes. &#8220;Uncle Percival will think
of something nice, I guess. And I&#8217;m glad the
storm didn&#8217;t come to-morrow, anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it will.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;Perhaps it won&#8217;t!&#8221; Kittie&#8217;s face and voice
were full of sunshine.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Kittlin&#8217;,&#8221; said aunt Puss, coming
in at that moment, and kissing the girls. &#8220;That&#8217;s
right, dear, always look on the bright side; and if
you can&#8217;t find it in to-day, borrow it from to-morrow.
The Bible doesn&#8217;t anywhere say, &#8216;sufficient
unto the day is the <i>good</i> thereof.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Kittie, returning the kiss
affectionately, &#8220;what did you call me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the old Scotch form of &#8216;kitten,&#8217;&#8221; said aunt
Puss, smiling. &#8220;I first came across it in George
MacDonald&#8217;s story of Alec Forbes&mdash;which you
both must read before you&#8217;re much older.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sunshine from Kittie&#8217;s face began to rest on
Bess, and to shine back a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Kit always does, auntie,&#8221; she declared;
&#8220;looks on the bright side. When anybody&#8217;s
sick at our house, and there&#8217;s no particular change,
she always says to people that inquire, &#8216;No worse,
thank you!&#8217; instead of &#8216;No better,&#8217; the way some
folks do.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the kitchen table, the subject was started up
again, and Randolph volunteered one of the little
rhymes his brother had written. It was as follows:</p>

<div class="indent">Until the long, dark night should pass away.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">One afternoon, in sad, unquiet mood,</div>
<div class="indent">I passed beside this tiny, bright-faced flower,</div>
<div class="verse">And begged that he would tell me, if he could,</div>
<div class="indent">The secret of his joy through sun and shower.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">He looked at me with open eyes, and said:</div>
<div class="indent">&#8220;I know the sun is somewhere shining clear,</div>
<div class="verse">And when I cannot see him overhead,</div>
<div class="indent">I try to be a little sun, right here!&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When the applause had ceased, and the talk had
drifted in other directions, Mr. Percival looked
around the circle and with a twinkle in his eye
proposed that after breakfast the young people
should make him a visit in his den.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll have a rag fire,&#8221; he added soberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>rag</i> fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. In the summer time I rarely burn anything
but rags in the den.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Now this &#8220;Den&#8221; was a most mysterious locality,
which they had often heard alluded to, but where
little company was admitted. Mr. Percival, I
should add, was, as you may have guessed from
aunt Puss&#8217; remarks about the &#8220;kittlin&#8217;,&#8221; a most
earnest reader and lover of George MacDonald&#8217;s
books, which perhaps accounts for the curious arrangement
I am about to describe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we to put on our wraps, Uncle?&#8221; asked
Kittie, in some doubt whether the Den was out-of-doors.
&#8220;O, I <i>wish</i> Pet was here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pet shall come too, the very first rainy day.
No; you&#8217;ll need no wraps, dear. Only follow me
softly, and don&#8217;t speak aloud!&#8221; And his eyes
twinkled again as he led the way out of the
kitchen, and toward the front part of the house.</p>

<p>I have already, in the former volume of this
series, partly described this old &#8220;mansion-house&#8221;
which the Percivals had occupied for generations.
The earliest of the family, Sir Richard Percyvalle,
came over from the north of England in 1690 or
thereabouts. Half a Scotchman, he brought with
him alike the love of wild country, and of the
ancient castles and baronial halls so dear to the
Englishman. This &#8220;mansion-house,&#8221; as it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
called throughout the county, situated in the
heart of a pine forest, near rugged hills and dancing
brooks, was the result. And here some branch
of the Percival stock had lived contentedly ever
since, respected and loved by their few neighbors;
some, indeed, finding their way to the great cities
and universities and even back across the Atlantic,
in pursuit of their education and professional
studies; but at least one manly representative of
the family always inhabiting the old house, which
stood as stanchly as ever against the blasts of the
North Wind and the rigors of the New England
winter. It had all sorts of wings, ells and additions
built on, extending the original structure as
the occupant&#8217;s whims or needs demanded. The
portion in actual use by the family throughout the
year was but a small fraction of the whole house.</p>

<p>The injunction not to speak aloud considerably
increased the fun as well as the awe of the occasion,
as Randolph, with his cousins, followed their
uncle in a dumb but not altogether silent row.</p>

<p>Leaving the kitchen, they crossed a narrow
passage-way leading into the sitting-room. Beyond
this was a sort of closet or cloak-room, and then
the front entry, a cold, cheerless place with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
green fan-light over the door which was now
entirely disused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here the carriages used to drive up in ancient
days,&#8221; said Mr. Percival, &#8220;the postilions cracking
their whips and the clumsy wheels lumbering
heavily over the driveway. Then elegant ladies
would alight, and passing through the open door
ascend that staircase, their long gowns, stiff with
silk and brocade, trailing behind them. Hark!
Do you hear them rustling past us and up the
stairs?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls listened, partly for the fun of the thing,
and partly because of the impressiveness of their
uncle&#8217;s manner. The rain beat drearily upon the
door, and long, hanging vines brushed against it
on the outside. Within, it was so dark that they
could scarcely distinguish the staircase.</p>

<p>On they went again, up the very stairs the bygone
beauties had ascended, through two broad
chambers whose shutters were closed and nailed
tight. Then down again, over a narrow flight of
steps, and along a crooked passage, so dark that
they had to feel their way.</p>

<p>Kittie laughed nervously, as she clutched Bessie&#8217;s
hand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>&#8220;Did you ever see anything like it!&#8221; she
whispered. &#8220;I feel exactly as if I were in a
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we&#8217;d stayed in the kitchen,&#8221; said Tom.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the good of coming into this dark hole?
I&#8217;m going back.&#8221; And in spite of the remonstrances
of the others, he turned and retraced his
steps.</p>

<p>The sound of his footfalls, echoing down the
passage, made the place drearier than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said Mr. Percival, out of the darkness.
&#8220;Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>They paused and strained their ears to catch a
sound above that of the storm, whose dull roar
beat indistinctly, like ocean waves, on the gables
overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hear something!&#8221; exclaimed Randolph
under his breath, entering fully into the spirit of
the adventure.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221; said both girls at once. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
kind of creaking, snapping noise!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; added Mr. Percival solemnly, throwing
open a door they had not before perceived, &#8220;is the
entrance to the Den.&#8221;</p>

<p>The room into which they now emerged from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
the narrow entry was apparently once intended for
a dining-hall, though the young people had never
before known of even its existence. It was of
oblong shape, and had at one end a huge fireplace.
The windows were heavily shuttered; the
air was damp and musty. In the dim light they
could make out clusters of old-fashioned candelabra,
projecting here and there from the walls like
spectral arms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Mr. Percival, advancing
toward the end of the shadowy room. To the
surprise of all three, he walked straight into the
fireplace, stooping but slightly to avoid the mantel.
The rest followed him, wondering. The
snapping noise was now louder than ever. Outside,
the wind moaned drearily.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival now turned sharply to the left and
pressed with the flat of his hand against a projecting
brick upon that side of the fireplace.</p>

<p>What was the utter amazement of Randolph and
the girls, as they crowded up to discover what he
was about, to see&mdash;not a brick wall where had
been one a moment before, but mere black space.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said their uncle again, stepping
into the opening.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>Randolph went in after him, and the girls next,
not without their misgivings.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s exactly like a dream!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or the Arabian Nights. Pinch me, Bess, to
see if I&#8217;m asleep!&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as they found themselves in the new
passage, they heard the wall close behind them.
Half a dozen steps further, and&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my Den!&#8221; said Mr. Percival.</p>

<p>The girls rubbed their eyes, and stared silently.
This is what they saw:</p>

<p>A small room, perhaps ten feet square. One
window, with a deep casement, making a window-seat
at least two feet wide. A warm-tinted carpet
on the floor, where three Maltese kittens tumbled
over each other in solemn play; walls lined with
books from floor to ceiling; an open fire of twigs
and stiff birch bark, blazing cheerily in a wee fireplace&mdash;and
in front of it, rocking serenely to and
fro with her knitting, aunt Puss! She looked up
with her pleasant smile as the young people entered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gave you a good surprise this time, dears,
didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw anything like it!&#8221; they exclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
in a breath. &#8220;How in the world did <i>you</i> get here,
ma&#8217;am?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Percival looked at her husband, who took
his seat in the large, old-fashioned arm-chair which
played an important part during the &#8220;Pine Cone
stories&#8221; in the winter; at the same time motioning
to the others to lie down on a bear-skin rug, before
the fire. It must be borne in mind that in Northern
Maine it is cool enough for fires, on stormy
days, throughout the year.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; he began, &#8220;it&#8217;s of no use making
a mystery of it any longer. The fact is, you are in
a chimney at this minute. Look!&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed to the ceiling, which they now
noticed was of some dark wood. In the centre, or
nearly so, was an opening, about eighteen inches
square and cased in the same wood, through which
they could see the sky. The opening was covered
at the top, far above the level of the ceiling, by a
dull, glazed window, which could be raised or closed
from below by means of strong cords.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&mdash;what has become of the fire and
the bricks, and all that, sir?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said uncle Will, stooping to pick
up two of the kittens in one hand. &#8220;In old times,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
when my great-grandfather lived here, there was
always danger of attack of some kind. The woods
were full of Indians, though most of them hereabout
were friendly, and there was a large Indian village
on the shores of the pond, where the old gentleman
and his family were held in equal love and respect.
However, roving bands were likely to turn up at
any time, with tomahawk and scalping-knife. Then
there were privateering squads of outlaw French and
Canadians, who made raids on the frontier; and as
we were always stanch Whigs, the family was not
safe even from the English, the royalist partisans
having suspicions of a spy in this locality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought &#8216;Whigs&#8217; were the government party
in England,&#8221; put in Randolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;So they are, to-day; but in the old Revolutionary
times the Tories were for the king, and the
Whigs for independence. Well, for all these reasons,
it was thought best to have some secret hiding-place
and way of escape, in case of need. Where
we are now, stood a huge chimney, some eight feet
square, supported on stone-and-brick arches in the
cellar. Around this chimney, as a precaution
against fire, was left a space of two or three feet
between the bricks and the wall of the house on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
that side where you see my little window. A sliding
door was constructed in the side of the dining-hall
fireplace, by which one could enter this space,
and from that a trap-door opened upon a rough
staircase, into the cellar under the masonry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem possible that such things can
really be, right here in Maine!&#8221; exclaimed Bess.
&#8220;It&#8217;s like stories.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they can really be&mdash;as they are&mdash;in thousands
of ancient dwellings in Europe and the East,
why not in America, where the dangers were quite
as terrible? Besides, dear, you will find out some
day that the real life of people going on everywhere
around you is much more strange than any
story-book you ever read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But please, wouldn&#8217;t one starve or smother in
that place down cellar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the narrow space under the arches, I am
told there led a long, underground passage-way,
which came to the surface within a quarter of a
mile of the house. I always fancied it was in the
pasture, but never could find it. This end was
tightly closed up&mdash;if indeed the whole passage-way
was not an empty tale&mdash;years before I was
born.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;And what has become of the chimney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was taken out as useless and unsafe, when
I was a boy. A few years ago it occurred to me
to wall in and fit up the space as a little study.
The ordinary entrance is from the sitting-room
closet, only ten feet from where you sit now. That
is the way your aunt Puss came in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls gave a relieved laugh as the vague
terrors of the winding and shadowy halls melted.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s as cosey as it can be,&#8221; said Kittie, stroking
one of her namesakes, and glancing over the
books, the writing desk in one corner, and the
dancing flames.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the rags, the rags!&#8221; cried Bess. &#8220;You
said you only burned rags, Uncle. Now I&#8217;ve
caught you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Randolph,&#8221; remarked Mr. Percival, without
directly answering her question, &#8220;will you please
hand me that small book on the third shelf behind
you&mdash;no, the next&mdash;that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He ran the leaves over rapidly, and handed the
book back, open, to the boy. &#8220;Please read that
verse. The writer, who you will see is Mr. Trowbridge,
is supposed to be searching the woods for
a bird whose song he has just heard.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>Randolph turned his back a little to the fire, as
he lay on the bear-skin, and read as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Long-drawn and clear its closes were&mdash; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div class="indent">As if the hand of Music through</div>
<div class="indent">The sombre robe of silence drew</div>
<div class="verse">A thread of golden gossamer;</div>
<div class="indent">So pure a flute the fairy blew.</div>
<div class="verse">Like beggared princes of the wood,</div>
<div class="verse">In silver rags the birches stood;</div>
<div class="verse">The hemlocks, lordly counselors,</div>
<div class="verse">Were dumb; the sturdy servitors,</div>
<div class="verse">In beechen jackets patched and gray,</div>
<div class="verse">Seemed waiting spell-bound all the day</div>
<div class="verse">That low, entrancing note to hear,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent5">&#8220;<i>Pe-wee! pe-wee! peer!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The reader looked up, and seeing the interested
faces of his listeners, begged leave to read two
more verses, they were so quaintly lovely:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I quit the search, and sat me down</div>
<div class="indent">Beside the brook, irresolute,</div>
<div class="indent">And watched a little bird in suit</div>
<div class="verse">Of sombre olive, soft and brown,</div>
<div class="indent">Perched in the maple branches, mute;</div>
<div class="verse">With greenish gold its vest was fringed,</div>
<div class="verse">Its tiny cap was ebon tinged,</div>
<div class="verse">With ivory pale its wings were barred,</div>
<div class="verse">And its dark eyes were tender-starred.</div><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
<div class="verse">&#8220;Dear bird,&#8221; I said, &#8220;what is thy name?&#8221;</div>
<div class="verse">And twice the mournful answer came,</div>
<div class="verse">So faint and far, and yet so near,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent5">&#8220;<i>Pe-wee! pe-wee! peer!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For so I found my forest bird,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent">The pewee of the loneliest woods,</div>
<div class="indent">Sole singer in these solitudes,</div>
<div class="verse">Which never robin&#8217;s whistle stirred,</div>
<div class="indent">Where never blue-bird&#8217;s plume intrudes.</div>
<div class="verse">Quick darting through the dewy morn,</div>
<div class="verse">The redstart trilled his twittering horn</div>
<div class="verse">And vanished in thick boughs; at even</div>
<div class="verse">Like liquid pearls fresh showered from heaven,</div>
<div class="verse">The high notes of the lone wood-thrush</div>
<div class="verse">Fell on the forest&#8217;s holy hush;</div>
<div class="verse">But thou all day complainest here,&mdash;</div>
<div class="indent5">&#8220;<i>Pe-wee! pe-wee! peer!</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> lovely!&#8221; said Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one word in it that I don&#8217;t like,
though,&#8221; remarked aunt Puss, making her needles
gleam in the firelight as they flew faster than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; cried Kittie, catching her eye, &#8220;it&#8217;s
&#8216;complainest&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Tom came in, evidently from the
guidance of Ruel, outside. His sisters were too
much interested in the room and the poem to
notice that his clothes were wet, as if he had been
in the rain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;Better come up by the fire, old fellow,&#8221; said
Randolph, so quietly that the others did not hear.
Tom started, but did as his cousin suggested,
without a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, dear,&#8221; continued aunt Puss, &#8220;no
bird ever &#8216;complains&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but it&#8217;s just poetry, you know, Aunt,&#8221; said
Bess eagerly. &#8220;Of course the birds don&#8217;t <i>really</i>
complain&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good poetry is always true,&#8221; said Mr. Percival.
&#8220;Your aunt seems to me quite right, my
girl. The lovely things that our Father has made
should not be described as &#8216;complaining,&#8217; even in
fancy. After what is said in the Book, about
sparrows, surely no bird ought to complain even of
falling to the ground. The real secret of it was, I
suspect, that the writer was himself in an unquiet
mood, and made the &#8216;little bird in suit of sombre
olive&#8217; sing out his own discontent&mdash;as we are
very apt to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the rags&mdash;O, I see, I see, it&#8217;s just birch bark
hanging on the trunks and boughs of the
trees!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said uncle Percival, smiling,
&#8220;whose favorite tree was the white birch, when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
were talking around our pine-cone fire last winter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine,&#8221; said Bess. &#8220;But I never thought of
the bark as &#8216;silver rags&#8217;; nor of the trees as
princes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not have a silver-rag story as well as
pine-cone stories?&#8221; asked Randolph. &#8220;We can
throw on bits of bark to keep the fire up, just as
we did the cones; we only want a little blaze, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid of it, I was afraid of it!&#8221;
exclaimed Mr. Percival in mock dismay. &#8220;I think
I have an engagement in the lower pasture!&#8221;</p>

<p>An immediate assault followed, from which the
good-natured old man rescued himself at last,
breathless and rumpled, on promise of a story.
Several broad sheets of birch bark were drawn
from a little cupboard beside the fireplace and
given to the girls, who tore them into thin, silky
strips, to be tossed on the fire during the progress
of the story.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br />


<small>A SMALL HERO.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;DID you ever hear how a small boy&mdash;a very
small boy indeed&mdash;saved Holland?&#8221; began
Mr. Percival, after reflecting a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;O no, sir. Is it a true story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely true, with the exception, perhaps,
of the name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We never heard of him, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were a set of Dutch young people, you
would have! The boy Hans, that did this brave
deed, was a far finer fellow than Casabianca, who
&#8216;stood on the burning deck,&#8217; and supposed his
father wanted him to burn to death for nothing
but sheer obedience. For Hans accomplished
something by his grand courage and endurance;
he saved a whole nation!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do tell us about him. Kittie, throw on another
piece of bark, and don&#8217;t let that cunning little
Maltee tumble into the fire!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Well, Holland, you see, is a queer place.
Hundreds of years ago people came upon a great
swampy piece of land, running far out into the
sea, and said, &#8216;Now if we could only keep out the
ocean in some way, this would be a nice place to
live in. We could have towns and cities all along
the coast, and we could build ships to sail around
the world, and at last we should become so powerful
that any nation would be glad to call us
friends.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Accordingly they set their wits to work to
devise some plan for holding back the salt tides,
which rose and fell as they pleased all through the
borders of this country. Then they began to
build huge mounds of earth, or &#8216;dykes,&#8217; along the
shore; and they kept on building until they had a
strong earthen wall nearly or quite around their
land. Randolph, do you know any similar place
in the Western Continent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In some parts of Nova Scotia, I believe, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And along the Mississippi,&#8221; added Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, both of you. The result was that the
sea could no longer flood the fields, but threw its
great waves and white foam against the outside of
the dykes as if it were always trying to push its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
way in. As soon as people were sure their farms
would not be washed away and their cattle drowned,
they built towns, which grew and prospered amazingly.
There was so little high land that there
were but few streams powerful enough to turn
mill-wheels, so they made wind-mills to grind their
wheat and corn. Finally the country was named
&#8216;Holland,&#8217; and, as the first dyke-builders had
expected, great nations were glad to win their
good-will.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not many years ago there lived in Holland a
small boy, rather strong for his age and size, whom
we will call Hans Van Groot. His home was near
the sea; and after he had attended to all his duties
about home, he liked nothing better than to take a
walk with his father along the top of the dyke, and
watch the white cows, as he called the foamy waves,
come rushing up to the shore, shaking their heads
and bellowing at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, no!&#8217; he would cry out, laughing gleefully,
&#8216;you can&#8217;t get in, you can&#8217;t get in! The fence is
too strong for you!&#8217;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_094fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;THE WAVES WERE RUNNING ENORMOUSLY LARGE.&#8221;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;He might well say so; for this was a peculiarly
dangerous point on the coast, and the people
knew that if the ocean should break the dyke all
Holland would be in peril, and thousands of lives,
as well as no end of valuable property, would be
lost. So they had made the sea-wall doubly thick
and high for several miles in each direction.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve seen the waves dash up that way on Star
Island, at the Shoals,&#8221; said Bess. &#8220;They are awful,
after a storm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On one of these quiet evening walks Hans&#8217;
father had been talking to him about little faults.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If you do wrong once, my boy,&#8217; he said, &#8216;no
matter how little a wrong it is, there will some
other bad thing be pretty apt to follow it; and so
all the good in you may be swept away, bit by bit,
until it is almost impossible to stop it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But it could be stopped very easily at first,
father, you mean?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes, Hans; just as you could stop with one
finger a tiny leak in this dyke, which before morning
would be a roaring flood so strong that no human
power could hold it back. And Holland would
be lost.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hans pondered over this a great deal, in his
quiet way, as he went to bed that night and drove
the cattle back and forth from their pasture during
the next few days. He was thinking of it as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
walked along the sea-shore about a week later. His
father was not with him this time, having gone to
a city several miles away to spend the night with a
sick friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mr. Percival reached this point in his story,
a gust of wind arose that made the old house creak
and tremble in every joint; floods of rain dashed
against the little window, and the smoke at intervals
puffed from the fireplace out into the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;There had been a long storm, and to-night the
waves were running enormously large&mdash;larger
than Hans had ever seen them. It was flood tide;
and as they rolled up, one by one, like long green
hills, they would topple over and break with a
sound like thunder, so near that the spray flew all
over Hans and soaked him through before he had
been there two minutes. He was plodding along,
with head bent down against the wind, when all at
once his heart stood still, and he could almost feel
his hair start up in terror at what he saw. If you
had seen it, perhaps you wouldn&#8217;t have noticed it;
but he knew what it meant. It was a very, very
small stream of water trickling out through the soil
and gravel on the <i>inside</i> of the dyke. Hans knew
it was the sea, which had at last found its way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
through. &#8216;Before morning,&#8217; his father had said!
Hans thought one moment of the awful scene that
was coming, and the picture of his own home, surrounded
by the terrible waves, rose before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He threw himself flat upon the dyke, and
thrusting the forefinger of his right hand into the
hole, shrieked for help.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was about sunset, and the good Dutch
country people were all at home for the night.
The nearest house was half a mile away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t he put a rock or a stick of wood
in?&#8221; demanded Kittie eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no wood handy, I suppose; and even
if there had been, the water would have soon forced
it out of the hole. A pebble would have been useless
for the same reason. No, the boy must hold
the ocean with his one little hand&mdash;the wind pushing,
the moon pulling against him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Help! help! The dyke is breaking!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody came. The night-fogs began to creep
up from the sea, the wind shifted back to the old
stormy quarter and blew hard toward the land.
The tide was still rising, and the &#8216;white cows&#8217;
outside bellowed more and more terribly. The
stars went out, one by one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Help!&#8217; Hans felt his finger, his hand, his
whole arm, beginning to ache from the strained
position, but he did not dare to change. Would
nobody come?</p>

<p>&#8220;Blacker and blacker grew the night. The awful
booming of the sea drowned entirely the now
feeble cry of the boy. The leak was stopped: but
could he bear it much longer? The pain shot up
and down his arm and shoulder like fire-flashes,
until he groaned and cried aloud. He said his
prayers, partly for somebody to come and partly
for strength to hold out till they did.</p>

<p>&#8220;The temptation came to him powerfully to take
out his aching hand and run away. Nobody would
know of it; and the pain was so keen! But he
said his little Dutch prayers the harder, and&mdash;held
on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;In the early gray of the morning a party of
men came clambering along the dyke, shouting and
swinging lanterns. At last one of them&mdash;can you
guess which?&mdash;espied what looked like a heap of
rags lying on the ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_098fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;CALLING ANXIOUSLY FOR HIM.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s his clothes!&#8217; he cried, in a trembling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
voice. Then, &#8216;It&#8217;s Hans himself, thank God!
thank God!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had &#8216;held on,&#8217; you see, until he fainted
with pain and exhaustion. Wet through, cold as
ice, his whole hand and arm swelled terribly, he
still held on, unconsciously, with his finger in the
leak.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Hans prevented the destruction of the great
dyke. He lost his own right hand in doing it, to
be sure; but in losing that he had saved Holland.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One more! One more!&#8221; chorused the children,
as their uncle concluded. &#8220;That was so
short!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said he, good-naturedly, &#8220;throw on a few
more &#8216;silver rags&#8217;, Tom; there&#8217;s just time for a
very short one before dinner. Do you remember
that little Fred Colebrook who came here for a few
minutes, the day the Indians were tried?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one with the curly hair? Yes, sir. He&#8217;s
visiting at Mr. Thompson&#8217;s, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; his home is in a queer place&mdash;at least,
what was his home till last year, when his folks
moved to the city.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a little valley, with huge mountains on
every side, so steep and so close together that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
would think there was no way to get through to the
world outside. Some of the mountains were covered
with pine and spruce trees, clinging to their
sides like the shaggy fur of a Newfoundland dog;
others were bare from top to bottom, with bits of
red stone tumbling over their ugly-looking ledges
almost every day. The valley itself was pretty
enough, with its tiny green meadow, and a brook
which laughed and played in the sunshine all day
long. It was rather a lonesome place, to be sure,
but Fred did not mind that; for did he not have his
father, and his mother, and the workingman for
company; besides the old red cow, the horses, and
five small gray kittens? These kittens were Fred&#8217;s
special pets. He was never tired of feeling their
soft fur and cool little feet against his cheek, and
hearing their sleepy <i>purr-r-purr-r</i>. Sometimes he
would carry one of them slyly up to the sober cow,
feeding quietly in front of the house, and place the
kitten on her back. It was hard to tell which was
more astonished, the kitten or the cow. At any
rate, they both would jump, with such funny looks
of surprise, and the kitten would run away as fast
as ever she could, to tell her adventure to the other
four.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;One warm afternoon in June, Fred was sitting
on the piazza watching the kittens, as they tumbled
about after their own tails, scampered across
the green, or hunted grasshoppers from spot to
spot. The breeze blew softly, and there was no
sound in the air but the rush of the brook, just below
the hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;The kittens raced about harder than ever. One
of them in particular, whose name was Mischief,
was more active than all the rest. She would jump
up into the air, turn somersaults, and finally took
several steps on her hind paws in her eagerness to
catch a bright red butterfly, just over her head.
All this amused Fred greatly as he sat there in the
warm sunlight, with his head leaning against the
door-post. But Mischief still kept on, becoming
more and more daring. She seemed to have fairly
learned to keep her balance on two feet, with the
aid of her bushy tail, for she ran about, to and fro,
with her fore-paws stretched out after the butterfly,
like a child. Once or twice she laughed aloud.
It did not seem so strange, when she was standing
up in that fashion, nor was Fred at all surprised to
notice that she seemed much larger than ever before.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Of course,&#8217; he thought, &#8216;one is taller standing
up than when one is on one&#8217;s hands and knees.&#8217;
The other kittens had by this time disappeared entirely
from sight, leaving only Mischief, who now
walked about more slowly, and, having caught the
butterfly, came sauntering up to where Fred was
sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mischief,&#8217; he began severely, &#8216;you&#8217;ve no
right to treat that poor butterfly&#8217;&mdash;Here he
stopped, rather puzzled; what she held in her
hand was certainly no butterfly; it was a fan,
covered with soft black and scarlet feathers, and
richly ornamented with gems.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well,&#8217; said the kitten, carelessly, &#8216;go on. You
were saying it was nothing but-a-fly, I think;&#8217; and
she stooped slightly to arrange the folds of her
dress. This was of delicate gray velvet, fitting
closely to her pretty figure and trailing on the
grass behind her. Indeed, Fred now saw that she
was not a kitten at all, but a dainty little lady,
about as high as his shoulder. She watched him
with an amused smile, and continued to fan herself.
&#8216;I had such a run for this fan,&#8217; she went on, as if
to put the boy at his ease; &#8216;the wind blew it quite
out of my hand, and&mdash;dear me, there it goes
again!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>&#8220;As she was speaking, the fan made a queer
sort of flutter in her hands, and floated off into the
sunshine. She sprang lightly into the air, whirled
around after it until Fred&#8217;s head was giddy, then
walked back quietly and stood before him again,
fanning herself slowly, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred felt that to be polite he ought to say
something.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t understand, Miss &mdash;&mdash; Miss &mdash;&mdash;&#8217; he
paused doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s right; Mischief,&#8217; she said promptly.
&#8216;You needn&#8217;t trouble yourself to name me over
again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But you&#8217;re not Mischief,&#8217; persisted Fred. &#8216;At
least not the one I know. She&#8217;s a kitten.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, what am I, pray?&#8217; Fred rubbed his
eyes; there she stood, looking almost exactly as
she had a minute before; yet that was certainly a
fuzzy gray tail resting on the grass, and these
were certainly his kitten&#8217;s paws and round eyes.
She was purring softly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Now, Mischief,&#8217; he cried out eagerly, &#8216;you&#8217;ve
been playing tricks, and I&#8217;m going to stroke you
the wrong way, to pay up for it.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>&#8220;The kitten stopped purring. &#8216;Don&#8217;t,&#8217; she said,
sharply; &#8216;you&#8217;ll crumple my dress! There,&#8217; she
added, in a gentler tone, seeing his dismay, &#8216;you
didn&#8217;t mean any harm. Be a good boy and I&#8217;ll let
you take a walk with me.&#8217; She threw away her
fan, and held out her little gloved hand to him, as
she spoke, for she was a lady again beyond all
doubt. Fred took her hand with some hesitation,
and off they started together. As they walked
along, side by side, Mischief kept up such a steady,
soft little flow of talk that Fred could not tell it
from purring half the time. At last they reached
the foot of one of the high mountains, and Mischief
began to scramble up, pulling him along as
she did so.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I&mdash;never&mdash;was here before,&#8217; he tried to
say, as his little guide leaped from rock to stump,
catching them gracefully, and swinging him up
after her. Mischief never stopped, however, until
they reached the very tip-top. Then they sat
down to rest on a mossy rock. The view was glorious;
Fred could see his house, nestling in the valley
far, far below him, and looking no bigger than
a pin in a green pincushion.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Speaking of pins,&#8217; said Mischief, as if she read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
his thoughts, &#8216;how many pine needles are there in
a bunch? I suppose you learned that at school.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No,&#8217; said Fred, &#8216;we had how many shillings
there are in a guinea, and how many rods make a
furlong, and&mdash;&#8217; Here Mischief appeared so intensely
interested that he was quite confused, and
stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Go on,&#8217; she cried, impatiently; &#8216;how do you
make your fur long?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred was dreadfully puzzled. &#8216;Excuse me,&#8217; he
said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t think you quite understood me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, never mind. How about the needles?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I never learned that table.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Humph! I thought everybody knew there
were three in a bunch on a pitch pine, and five in
a bunch on a white pine. It&#8217;s in the catechism.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No, it&#8217;s not,&#8217; said Fred, decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It ought to be, then, which is precisely the
same thing with us kittens.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It isn&#8217;t with folks,&#8217; said Fred.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, let me see if you know anything at all.
Do you see that black cloud coming up over the
hills?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes&#8217;m.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Probably it will rain to-night, will it not?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Yes&#8217;m,&#8217; replied Fred again, meekly.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why should it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred looked at the cloud blankly; he really had
never thought of this before.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Of course you don&#8217;t know,&#8217; said Mischief,
after waiting a moment for him to answer. &#8216;It&#8217;s
because every drop of water in that cloud has thin,
gauzy wings of fog, and when they happen to come
across a cold breeze&mdash;as they often do in these
high mountains&mdash;they shiver and fold up their
wings so they can&#8217;t fly any more, and down they
come in what you call a rain storm. I knew that
before I had my eyes open. Now,&#8217; she continued,
&#8216;I&#8217;m going to try you just once more, and then we
must be going. Did you ever see a kitten walk on
tip-toes?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Never,&#8217; said Fred. &#8216;Except,&#8217; he added slyly,
&#8216;when they jump after butterflies.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mischief laughed outright. &#8216;Dear me, you
funny boy,&#8217; she said, &#8216;where <i>have</i> you been to
school? Why, <i>all</i> kittens walk on tip-toes, from
morning till night. That little crook that looks
like a knee is really a kitten&#8217;s heel. Horses walk
the same way, only they have just one toe to walk
on, and that longer then your arm. You ask that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
little gray-bearded man with the blue spectacles,
that comes here once in a while, and he will tell
you that many thousand years ago horses had as
many toes as kittens, but they are such great, awkward
things that all their other toes have been
taken away from them. A cow has&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I know!&#8217; cried Fred. &#8216;She has a cloven
hoof, without any toes at all.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You&#8217;re all wrong, as usual,&#8217; said Mischief
briskly; &#8216;what you call hoof is her two toes.
Though why she should be allowed to keep more
than a horse, I never could see. Great red thing!&#8217;
Just then, a big drop of rain came down, spat!
on Mischief&#8217;s nose. She rubbed it off hastily
with her nice little mouse-gray gloves, and looked
about her with a frightened air. &#8216;It never will do
for me to be caught in a shower,&#8217; she said, &#8216;or my
gloves and dress will be spotted. They&#8217;ve been in
the family a long time and were imported from
Malta.&#8217; Another drop struck her face, tickling
her so that she sneezed violently.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come!&#8217; she cried, and started off at a full
run, down the mountain-side, pulling Fred after
her as before. &#8216;Hurry, hurry,&#8217; she screamed;
&#8216;faster, faster!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;Fred now saw, to his horror, that instead of
descending the side on which they had come up,
she was making straight toward the slope where
the rocks were bare and red.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Stop, stop, Mischief!&#8217; he cried breathlessly,
&#8216;we shall go over the cliff!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before the words were fairly out of his mouth
they were on the crumbling edge of a precipice.
In that instant Fred could see the road and the
brook a thousand feet below them.</p>

<p>&#8220;He braced his feet against the stones and tried
to snatch his hand away, but Mischief held it more
tightly than ever. With one wild bound they were
over the brink, out in the empty air, falling down,
down&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, come, Fred, you&#8217;ll be wet through!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fred looked about him in amazement. He was
sitting on the piazza, and there was Mischief in
his lap. She was shaking off the rain-drops as
they fell thickly upon her soft fur, and was
struggling to get away from his hand, which was
tightly clasped about one of her fore-paws. His
other hand was held by his mother, who stood over
him, laughing and talking at the same time. &#8216;Why,
Fred, have you been here all the afternoon? I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
guess the kitten has had a nice nap; and just see
how it rains!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Mischief,&#8217; began Fred solemnly, letting go her
paw, &#8216;what have you been&mdash;?&#8217; but Mischief had
already jumped and run off to the barn, to find her
brothers and sisters.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br />


<small>OAK LEAVES AND HAY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">HOW it did pour that afternoon! It was of
no use to think of going into the woods
for leaves, and the girls had just about given up
all idea of decorating Pet&#8217;s room, when the kitchen
window was obscured by a queer object.</p>

<p>Kittie came flying out from the sitting-room,
closely followed by the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can it be?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;O, I know!
It&#8217;s Ruel&mdash;just see what he&#8217;s brought!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the kindly trapper, who loved the
young folks almost as if they were his own children,
had tramped off quietly to the wood, gathered a
huge armful of green oak boughs&mdash;and now stood,
beaming out of the midst of them, like a good-natured
Faun, fairly dripping from head to foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you mout like to be workin&#8217; while
your uncle was tellin&#8217; stories,&#8221; he called out.
&#8220;Where&#8217;ll you have em?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>&#8220;O, in the barn, the barn. We&#8217;ve been cooped
up in the house all day, and I&#8217;m just longing for a
breath of fresh air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus the energetic Bess.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the leaves are all wet,&#8221; objected Kittie.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t they hurt the hay, Uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Percival smiled, and patted the eager brown
head. &#8220;I guess they won&#8217;t spoil the whole mow,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;But of course I can&#8217;t tell you any
stories, because I&#8217;m going to toast my feet all the
afternoon in the Den.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kittie saw a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; she said coaxingly, &#8220;you&#8217;re just teasing
us. You&#8217;re going to come out where you can see
to Tim and Ruel while they work, and then you&#8217;re
going to climb up into the hay-mow and <i>tell</i>, while
we make trimming&mdash;aren&#8217;t you, Uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Aren&#8217;t</i> you, Uncle?&#8217;&#8221; repeated Mr. Percival
in a whimsical tone. &#8220;Why, if you&#8217;re such a very
earnest little puss about it, I suppose&mdash;I must!&#8221;</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t take long to prepare for the barn.
Hooded and water-proofed, the girls ran across the
little open space as fast as they could go, wagging
in and out under a big umbrella, screaming and
laughing, girl-fashion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>Tom and Randolph followed in more military
style, double-quicking in fine order from porch to
barn. The men were already there. In one of
the broad bays on the ground level of the barn
was a mow of new hay; and on the centre of this
was deposited a huge heap of leaves, wet and
shining, pretty material for busy fingers to transform
into links and wreaths and festoons for Pet&#8217;s
chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival was soon made comfortable in a
hay-nest especially hollowed out for him, and the
rest seated themselves in a semi-circle before him.
The boys were set to work at once, stripping off
leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; said Bess, beginning to turn the stout
stems and piercing the tough green tissue of the
leaves, &#8220;this is really&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice,&#8221; furnished Randolph gravely. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
good Boston word. Girls always say that the
weather is nice, and ice cream is nice, and going to
Europe is nice, and the sermon was nice, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O hear him, hear him!&#8221; interrupted Kittie.
&#8220;I guess &#8216;nice&#8217; is as good a word as &#8216;jolly.&#8217; Boys
all say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many a nice time, yes, and jolly too,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
uncle Will, as he watched the swallows overhead,
and listened with an amused smile to the children&#8217;s
funning, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had in this barn, in old times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were there many fellows about here?&#8221; asked
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not many, but perhaps we appreciated one
another all the better. The district school was
about a half a mile from the cross-roads, and we
boys were always ready for a good time. Once,
though, our sport came near turning out pretty
seriously for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How was that, sir?&#8221; The rest looked up with
interested faces, but kept on with their work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it was on a Saturday afternoon, I remember,
at about this time of year&mdash;no, it must have
been later&mdash;in August, I think.</p>

<p>&#8220;There were seven of us, just out of school, and
ready for anything in the shape of fun. It had
been a clear race from the schoolhouse&mdash;we never
could go anywhere without a run or a leap-frog, or
something of the sort&mdash;till we reached the shade
of an apple-tree, laughing, panting and eating apples.
The ground was covered with small, juicy
fruit, mellow on the upper side, and hard underneath.
They were pretty sour, but we didn&#8217;t care.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;It was only half-past four, and we had two good
hours before supper-time all to ourselves. So we
lay there, filling our pockets with apples after we
had eaten enough, and began to propose plans.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Let&#8217;s go down to the mill and see &#8217;em saw
logs.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Too far.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who says &#8216;I spy,&#8217; then?</p>

<p>&#8220;This suggestion was well received, and I, who had
made it, proceeded to count off, one dropping away
every time until the last, who happened to be Bob
Andrews&mdash;poor fellow, he was shot at Antietam!&mdash;was
&#8216;It,&#8217; and was posted against the tree with
his eyes covered.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Fifteen, twenty, twenty-five, thirty&mdash;I&#8217;m
comin&#8217; when I get to three hundred!&#8217; he shouted,
as we scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first I made for a low wall near the house,
and had hardly time to gain it when Bob gave a
flourish, and with a loud &#8216;Three hundred&mdash;comin&#8217;!&#8217;
started for his prey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peeping through a crevice in the wall, and finding
he was coming in my direction, I hurriedly
glanced about for a new hiding-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;At that moment a red squirrel bounded lightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
along the tops of the stones, and disappeared in a
crevice between two boards of the barn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Instantly I followed the hint. Creeping on my
hands and knees, I soon reached the corner of the
old gray building, and a moment later was in the
centre of the mow, burrowing down out of sight,
until I was pretty confident that it would take a
smarter boy than Bob Andrews to find me that
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was remarkably comfortable in that mow.
The hay was fresh on top, and although I had
reached the under layer of last year&#8217;s crop, I took
care not to disturb it much, so that the dust did
not trouble me. I could hear the shouts of the
boys as they were discovered, one after the other,
and the complaining tones of Bob, who, to my great
satisfaction, was ransacking every nook and corner
of the place except the right one.</p>

<p>&#8220;A couple of swallows flew in and out over my
head, twittering softly. Perhaps they were returning
for a last look at their old home, for it was
almost time they were away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether it was the soft August air, or the distant,
faint shouts of the boys, or the voice of the
swallows, I never knew; but when I roused myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
to climb down and have my laugh at the rest
of the fellows, to my surprise I found it was quite
dark. At the same time I began to experience a
smothering sensation, and an almost unbearable
heat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put up my hand. It instantly came into contact
with hay so dry that it made me sneeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tried to push it aside and to rise; but, to my
dismay, found myself held down tightly by an immovable
mass above, below, on all sides. I had at
first supposed the hay had tumbled or been thrown
down for fun upon me; but all in a flash, I realized
the truth. I had fallen asleep, and while unconscious,
had been covered, by some of the farm-hands,
who, I remembered, had been directed that
very morning to pitch the entire contents of
another mow upon this, as the flooring of the first
needed repairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sixteen, then, and pretty rugged for a
boy of my years; but I confess I felt a lump in my
throat and a faint, dizzy terror sweep over me from
head to foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Buried alive in a hay-mow! For a few minutes
I was quite frantic. I shrieked for help; I
dug furiously with hands and kicked with feet, until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
my smarting eyes, nostrils and throat, half-choked
with fine hay-dust, compelled me to desist.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I began to plan more deliberately. It was
pitch-dark, remember, and so close that I could
hardly breathe. The perspiration, too, was streaming
from every pore. If I had known my points of
compass, I could have made a bee-line for the nearest
limit of the mow, but I had turned in sleeping,
and struggled so violently afterward, that I was as
completely lost as though I had been in the Maine
wilderness.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no time to spare. My breath came
in a quick, heavy panting. I felt my strength
growing plainly less. At the same time, I began
to be hungry and thirsty. How much time had
elapsed since I had hidden away I could not tell.
Perhaps it was supper-time.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would I have given to have been sitting
in the smooth-floored, old kitchen, with my bowl
of bread and milk before me, relating my strange
adventure to the half-sympathizing, half-laughing
faces around the table?</p>

<p>&#8220;I began slowly to loosen the hay upon my right
side, which I judged was toward the centre of the
barn. If so, my course would bring me out through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
the side of the mow, twenty feet above the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was tedious work, for I dared not hurry lest
I should be overcome with heat and the dust, which
kept me coughing almost incessantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Handful after handful I pulled out and crowded
behind me. Every muscle ached with the cramped
position, and the air became more and more close.
Still, I worked on steadily, desperately. How long
it was I cannot tell&mdash;I never knew.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was drawing away the tightly-packed masses
of hay, a small bunch at a time, when the air suddenly
became perceptibly cooler and sweeter. I
dug at the cruel hay wall more furiously. Somewhere
beneath me I heard a slight scrambling and
rustling, which soon ceased.</p>

<p>&#8220;A moment later, my finger-ends struck the
rough surface of boards, and, as they did so, a cold,
delicious draught of air, like spring-water in a desert,
blew upon my hot cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt about eagerly, still seeing nothing, and
soon came upon a small hole or interstice, with
roughened sides, as if gnawed by some animal, between
the edges of two of the boards which formed
the partition I had met. It did not take me long,
country boy as I was, to reason out the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
that opening. It was a squirrel&#8217;s hole, without
doubt the very spot where my bushy-tailed guide
had disappeared, as I watched him from behind the
stone wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put my eye to the opening, and looked out.
To my astonishment, the stars were shining
brightly. Yes, and the moon! By its position in
the eastern sky&mdash;for it was past the full&mdash;I knew
at last how long I had been in that hay-mow. It
was between twelve and one o&#8217;clock, and for eight
hours I had been buried, lost, in the hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say had been, for now I felt quite at ease.
No more exploring for me that night! When
morning came, I could easily call through my
squirrel&#8217;s front-door, and the men who came out
early to milk would pitch off the hay, and release
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only trouble was hunger and thirst, which,
now that I had time to think of them, oppressed
me more than ever. Then I remembered those
apples. I suppose nothing will ever taste so good
as that sour, hard apple did that night. After I
had made a bountiful lunch, I enlarged my quarters
a little, settled back comfortably, and waited
for milking-time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s all there really is to tell. In due time,
the stars faded, one by one; the sky flushed all
sorts of lovely roses and pinks; the cattle began to
stir about uneasily underneath; a distant door
creaked, and heavy boots slowly approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;I placed my lips to the crack, and called in a
low tone. You see, I didn&#8217;t want to rouse all the
folks. I knew they wouldn&#8217;t be worried, because
I had planned to go over to Merritt&#8217;s and stop with
him that very night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, ten minutes later I stood on the barn-floor,
brushing the hay-seed from my hair and
clothes, and stretching my aching limbs. I found
the witch-grass had cut my fingers a little, and that
was about all the harm that came of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I expected them all to laugh at the breakfast-table,
and told my story rather sheepishly; but
when I got through, and looked round, the folks
had anything but smiling faces, and two of them
passed me the doughnuts, both at once. Mother
cried outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If he hadn&#8217;t taken the right direction,&#8217; she said,
&#8216;or had kept going in a circle&#8217;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she stopped; and so will I.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Kittie, drawing a long breath, &#8220;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
was a narrow escape. It makes me feel stifled
just to think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it this very barn, Uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Tom; and that further mow on the other
side, where Kittie found the man last winter, and
had such a fright.&#8221;</p>

<p>The trimming was nearly completed, but it still
needed to be brought into better shape, and a
special yard or two of smaller leaves made for the
looking-glass, Bess said. &#8220;And can&#8217;t you tell us
one more hay-mow story, uncle Will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me speak to Tim a minute,&#8221; said Mr. Percival.
&#8220;After I&#8217;ve given him some directions, I&#8217;ll
see if I can remember one.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a warm day in the early part of April,&#8221;
he began, as soon as he returned. &#8220;The air was
mild, the sky was blue, with sunlight, and the gentle
spring breezes were full of all sorts of nice
smells of fresh earth and green, growing turf.
The turf was in the moist places on the sunny
side of the old wall; above it, in their willow-baskets,
pussies were beginning to stretch out
their little gray paws sleepily, as they awoke one
by one from their long nap.</p>

<p>&#8220;As Zip spattered along the muddy roadside on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
his way home from Sunday-school, he thought the
world a pretty nice place to live in, on the whole.
&#8216;Zip,&#8217; by the way, was short for &#8216;Zephaniah,&#8217;
which was his long name. Folks only called him
that when they were full of fun or very cross;
indeed, you could generally tell which by their
tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;A robin in the overhanging boughs of an apple-tree
whistled cheerily as Zip drew near. Instantly
the boy seized a stone, and threw it at the red
feathers. The bird uttered a shrill cry of alarm,
but flew away unharmed, and presently was heard
again far away in the orchard. Zip was rather
glad of this, after all. He wasn&#8217;t a cruel boy, but
whenever he saw a bird or a squirrel, something
in him, he couldn&#8217;t tell what, made him throw
stones at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now Zip, as I said, had just been to Sunday-school,
and had been thinking almost all the way
home of the lesson. It was the story of the very
first Christian people, who started so bravely to be
good and true, and who tried to do just as Christ
of Nazareth had taught them and their fathers a
few years before.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;What a beautiful world it would be,&#8217; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
teacher had said, at the close of school, &#8216;if everybody
tried to do so now!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zip was only twelve years old, and didn&#8217;t know
much about the world any way, but he had
seen some acts that were quite unlike those of the
apostles so long ago. His father and mother were
plain country people, working hard from morning
till night, and giving no anxious thought to the
morrow, but a great deal to to-day, which was
pretty much the same thing, only they were one
day behind, and somehow could never catch up.
The hard-featured man at the counter of his country
store, and the tired-looking woman in the kitchen,
each spent their lives, it seemed to Zip, in getting
dinner or clearing it away. So it happened that
the boy was glad enough of his Sunday afternoon,
when, after returning from school, he had three
hours to himself before supper.</p>

<p>&#8220;As he neared home he saw the small cattle-door
of the barn left invitingly open. He turned
aside, picking his way among the brown pools and
streamlets that dimpled and twinkled in the sunlight,
and entered the great fragrant cave, lighted
only by cracks between the uneven boards, and a
knot-hole here and there far above his head. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
oxen raised their broad foreheads, knocking their
horns against the stanchions. Zip gave them each
a little pat between their meek brown eyes, and
scrambled up the ladder into the hay-mow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a delicious place for a quiet Sunday afternoon.
He waded over to the very centre of the
mow, dug a little hollow with his hands, and cuddled
down into it. Over his head were the dark
beams with their dusty webs and last year&#8217;s swallow&#8217;s
nests; beneath him he could hear the cattle
munching away at their hay and grain, and now
and then putting down a heavy foot on the floor of
their stalls. A dozen hens were stalking about,
picking wisely at various bits of grass-seed, and
clucking in soft tones. All around was the sweet
scent of the hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;As Zip lay in his snug nest he thought drowsily
of what the teacher had said about everybody
being good. How comfortable and happy it would
be! The more he thought about it the pleasanter
it seemed. Just then there came a long, low note
from one of the hens on the wide floor below. The
sound had so many quirks and turns in it, that Zip
half thought for a moment that it was some one
speaking to him, and started up to answer. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
he remembered it was only a hen, and leaned back
with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Presently he heard the same hen clucking, or
cackling, again, and so slowly and clearly did the
notes come that he could have stated to a positive
certainty that something had been said down there
on the barn-floor, and that, too, about himself. He
crept to the edge of the mow and looked over.
There were the hens just as he had often seen
them, only looking wiser than ever. Even while he
looked the brown pullet gave a vigorous scratch or
two, pecked at the dusty boards once or twice,
shook her feathers, and said distinctly,</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If they only knew!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zip stared. Then a deep, soft voice, hardly
more than a long, long sigh, came from directly beneath
him, &#8216;They would soon learn to be as quiet as
we are.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Star, the off-ox; there couldn&#8217;t be a
doubt of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; answered the brown pullet,
winking upside-down after her custom, &#8216;you great
things are almost too quiet. One has to be lively to
get one&#8217;s supper, you know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;As she spoke she made a quick run after a tiny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
insect which had been called out of its cranny by
the warm sun, caught it on the wing, and went on
with what she had been saying.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;In the first place, Star,&#8217; she said, more gravely,
&#8216;no one would be angry without good reason, and
then they wouldn&#8217;t beat animals for nothing, would
they, Billy?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The horse who was thus addressed seemed to
shake his mane, and said something which Zip
took to be a very prolonged &#8216;nay,&#8217; but he wasn&#8217;t
quite sure he answered at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nobody would be selfish, and everybody
would be kind,&#8217; continued Brown Pullet, &#8216;and trying
to please others instead of themselves. They
wouldn&#8217;t hurt the feelings of anybody nor any
thing. There&#8217;s Zip, now, he wouldn&#8217;t throw stones
at a robin; he would think how the poor little
bird-heart was beating faster and faster, and the
soft red feathers throbbing on her breast, as the
ugly stone came whizzing through the air to take
her life!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zip did think, and was sorry he threw the stone.
It was a comfort that he didn&#8217;t hit the bird, however,
and he made up his mind to throw out some
crumbs on the well-curb that very night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;&#8216;I declare,&#8217; said Brown Pullet, with her feathers
just a bit ruffled, &#8216;when I think of how pleasant
and kind and polite and gentle folks might be,
and how they do say sharp, hurtful things (which
I&#8217;ve heard people say do bruise one more even than
rocks), it makes me really&mdash;there!&#8217; she interrupted
herself, &#8216;I declare, I&#8217;m getting angry myself,
which don&#8217;t help matters much. The best
way for me to bring on the good times is to begin
myself. Speckle, Speckle,&#8217; she called to one of
her companions, &#8216;here&#8217;s the plumpest barleycorn
I&#8217;ve found to-day. I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t have any peace till I
see you eat it, to make up for my being cross to
you this morning when you tipped the water over
on my toes. It was cold, to be sure, but &#8217;twas all
an accident, and I oughtn&#8217;t to have pecked you for
it. Dear, dear, how late it&#8217;s getting! It&#8217;s quite
dark, da-a-rk, da-r-r-rk!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zip gave a little jump, he hardly knew why,
and looked about him. The hens were still walking
about the floor below, for he heard them as
plainly as before, only he couldn&#8217;t seem to make
out what they said, and somehow, too, he was back
in his soft hay-nest again. He rubbed his eyes,
and stretched his sturdy little arms, found his way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
down the ladder, and looked hard at the brown pullet.
But she merely clucked in her old way, and,
turning her head on one side, looked up at him
curiously out of her wise, round eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zip then went over to see the two oxen, but
they only lifted their heads and watched him in
silence for a moment, then gave two great, soft,
sweet-breathed sighs, and went on eating their
hay.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The oak-leaf decorations were now quite finished.
The remainder of the day, until dark, was spent
in festooning them about Pet&#8217;s room, over the doorways,
and even in the chamber to be occupied by
poor little Bridget Flanagan, the unrecognized
heroine of the Summer Street fire.</p>

<p>Ruel, coming in to supper, reported bright
streaks in the west, and predicted fair cool weather
on the morrow.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br />


<small>POOR TOM!</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT Ruel was a good weather-prophet, there
could be no doubt. Long before blue eyes
and brown were opened at The Pines, the sun was
shining over hill and valley, and birds singing in
every thicket, to welcome the bright day.</p>

<p>Plans were eagerly discussed at breakfast, and
by eight o&#8217;clock the great wagon was before the
door, ready for a start. Tom alone hung back and
refused to go, saying he wanted to walk over to the
Pond; so they drove off without him, toward the
Pineville Station.</p>

<p>The horses, who had just enjoyed a rainy day&#8217;s
rest in their stalls, stepped off merrily. How
sweet the air was! The girls and Randolph drew
in long breaths, and shouted and sang till they were
tired. Mr. Percival listened, and watched them
with kindly eyes, now and then engaging in the
conversation himself.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there any boys and girls around here
except ourselves?&#8221; asked Randolph as they
whirled along over the road, here carpeted with
pine needles.</p>

<p>&#8220;O there are plenty in Readville and Jamestown,&#8221;
replied his uncle, touching the glossy flank
of the off horse with his whip. &#8220;There&#8217;s a good-sized
school in each town, and they draw the young
folks together, from all parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they do for fun, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just now they&#8217;re full of base-ball. The
boys do the hard work, out in the sun, and the
girls make caps and badges for them and watch
them play. There&#8217;s a club in each town, I&#8217;m told.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How nice!&#8221; exclaimed Bess. &#8220;I do so like to
see real exciting games!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe we could drive over sometime,
Uncle?&#8221; asked Kittie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes indeed, yes indeed; take you over to-morrow
if you like&mdash;or send you with Ruel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d be glad enough to git the boys to play
with &#8217;em,&#8221; remarked Ruel, chiming in as his name
was spoken. &#8220;They always think city boys must
know how, because they&#8217;ve seen the big clubs.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_130fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;HE WAS OFTEN AWAY FROM THE HOUSE, ALONE.&#8221;</p>

<p>It might as well be added right here that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
boys did go over to Readville, though not on the
following day; and the village club were so well
pleased with their playing, that they invited the
new-comers to join their nine, during vacation, and
to take part in any matches that might occur.
Randolph, indeed, so gained in favor by his pleasant
ways and cool head that he was regularly
elected Captain. Tom did well, too, being a more
graceful player than his cousin, but not so reliable
in an emergency. All this I have mentioned, to
explain how the great Match Game came about, of
which we shall hear before long.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ride to the railroad progressed
pleasantly. An excursion to Bessie&#8217;s mountain
(where she had lighted the birch-tree torch during
the thunder-storm) was planned in all its details.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pet will soon be rested,&#8221; said Kittie in gleeful
tones, &#8220;and then we&#8217;ll have our picnic. Ruel, you
must take plenty of matches, and your axe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the axe fer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O tables, and a tent, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And birch bark,&#8221; added the guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;Birch bark? I thought you cut that off with
penknives. O, can we get a lot, to carry home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see why not, ef you c&#8217;n stan&#8217; the work.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Has Pet another watch?&#8221; asked Randolph
suddenly. &#8220;She said something about it in her
last letter to you, Bess, didn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Her father thinks it was careless of her
to lose it, now that it&#8217;s certain it didn&#8217;t go into the
pond when she fell overboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to know what&#8217;s the matter with
Tom,&#8221; broke in Kittie. &#8220;He&#8217;s acted queer, ever
since that day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Percival soberly. &#8220;I&#8217;m troubled
about the boy. He isn&#8217;t his old merry self at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say about the Indians that afternoon,
Uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Said he believed they took the watch and hid
it; and that he hadn&#8217;t seen it himself, and knew
nothing about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that at the trial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just before. He wasn&#8217;t in the house when we
examined the Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he thinks everything of Pet,&#8221; said Randolph.
&#8220;I guess he feels bad about her losing it,
and that&#8217;s what ails him. Hulloa, see that crow
on the fence just ahead there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone, he&#8217;s gone! O what are those little
birds fluttering round him?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>&#8220;Them&#8217;s king-birds,&#8221; said Ruel. &#8220;They can&#8217;t
put up with crows, nohaow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, are they fighting him now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Teeth an&#8217; claws. Look at him dive, to git out
o&#8217; their way!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do crows do any good, Ruel?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, I d&#8217;no. I s&#8217;pose, when you come right
daown to it, the creeturs ought ter be killed off.
They do suck small bird&#8217;s eggs, an&#8217; they&#8217;re a powerful
nuisance in a cornfield. But thar, I do hate
to shoot anything with wings on &#8217;em, in these big
woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Ruel?&#8221; inquired the boy curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wal, fer one reason, they&#8217;re good company,
even those black rascals. Many&#8217;s the time I&#8217;ve
been off alone in the woods, in the winter, when I
couldn&#8217;t see nor hear a livin&#8217; thing fer a week together.
An&#8217; some mornin&#8217; I&#8217;d hear a queer croakin&#8217;
noise near my cabin, an&#8217; thar&#8217;d be a crow&mdash;head
on one side, a-talkin&#8217; to a neighbor over&#8217;n a
pine. Their talkin&#8217; ain&#8217;t anything like their reg&#8217;lar
cawin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it sound like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I d&#8217;no. Like a hoarse old man, talkin&#8217; to
himself, p&#8217;raps. Anyway, it sounds sort o&#8217; human,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
and I couldn&#8217;t knock &#8217;em over, to save me.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the girls had found something else
to interest them by the roadside, in the tree-tops, or
the sky overhead; and so the ride went on, happily,
toward Pineville.</p>

<p>But it is time to look back a little, and see what
Tom is about, left alone at The Pines.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As soon as the rest were gone, Tom glanced
carelessly over his shoulder, and sauntered off toward
the woods. At a distance of about a thousand
feet from the house, he paused and looked curiously
about him. He had entered a clump of oaks
and birches, just on the edge of the pine forest;
before him lay a little valley, into which he descended,
and leaving the path, followed the course
of what was evidently in the spring season a small
stream, now entirely dry. Stepping cautiously, to
avoid treading upon dry twigs, he kept on down
the ravine until he reached a large bowlder, forming
the outworks of a picturesquely broken cliff
whose fern-draped front towered some forty feet or
more above his head.</p>

<p>An aged beech-tree, rooted about half-way up the
juncture of the boulder and the cliff, had bent downward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
in the course of years, until its lowermost
branches almost touched the ground. Seizing the
nearest of these, and aiding himself by slight projections
and crannies in the ledge itself, Tom drew
himself up to the thick end of the tree, upon the
curving trunk of which he seated himself, breathless.
He was now in a sort of cavity, formed by
the fall of the bowlder in ages past, which had given
shelter to the young beech and collected soil for its
nourishment. Ferns grew thickly above, below,
on every side, along the shelving surfaces, which,
projecting over Tom&#8217;s head, made a snug nook
some five or six feet deep. This hiding-place the
boy flattered himself was entirely his own discovery,
and thither he was accustomed to betake himself
on long summer afternoons; then, stretching
out comfortably at full length in the green shade, he
would fancy himself in a wild country, flying from
Indians; or would pull a book from his pocket, and
lose himself in tales of peril and adventure.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, he had no book, and
gave himself up to no day dreams. Instead, he
seemed worried and frightened, and peering downward
through the leaves, listened for any footstep
that might be approaching.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>No, he was quite alone. Only a thrush, singing
musically, near by; and from beyond, the solemn,
never-ceasing murmur of the pines.</p>

<p>With slow and careful movements, taking care
not to disturb the loose rocks or soil in the cavity,
the boy turned and thrust his arm into a narrow
cleft that had been concealed by a clump of ferns.</p>

<p>When he drew back his hand, something bright
gleamed in it. It was round, and shone gayly in an
innocent bit of sunlight that came flickering down
through the tree-tops. It was talking to itself,
too, in a very busy and wise little way, as Tom satisfied
himself at once, holding it to his ear and listening
anxiously.</p>

<p>What would Pet have thought, as she whirled
along in the North-bound express from Boston that
fair morning, could she have seen Tom crouching
on the shadowy ledge, trembling at every sound in
the forest, pale and frightened, clasping in his hand&mdash;her
lost watch? Poor Tom!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br />


<small>A MOUNTAIN CAMP.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;I &nbsp; SHOULD like to know,&#8221; said Pet breathlessly,
as she clambered up the steep slope of Saddleback,
a day or two after her return to The Pines,
&#8220;whether there really is any top to this hill!
Where was the birch you set on fire, Bess?&#8221;</p>

<p>The party paused a minute beside the path, to
rest and get breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, ever so far from here, away over on the
Readville side of the mountain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It spiles the looks of the tree,&#8221; observed Ruel,
leaning on his axe, &#8220;or I&#8217;d start one for ye naow.
Leaves &#8217;em all black, an&#8217; sometimes kills &#8217;em, right
aout&mdash;not to say anything &#8217;bout settin&#8217; the rest o&#8217;
the woods on fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a birch is that, over by that rock,
uncle Will?&#8221; asked Randolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;That? That&#8217;s a black birch. Nice tasting
bark. When we get to the top and have lunch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
we&#8217;ll talk about birches a little, if you like. Let
me see, whose favorite tree was it last year?
Tom&#8217;s?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bessie&#8217;s, of course. Tom&#8217;s was the oak, because
it wore squirrels and oak-leaf trimming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; said Tom, who, though a shade
paler than in the old days, seemed to have partially
recovered his spirits, &#8220;oak trees are stronger
and tougher than pines or birches either; and I
notice that uncle Will has a white oak cane, this
very minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Time&#8217;s up!&#8221; interrupted Ruel, who always
assumed the place of guide, not to say leader, in
such tramps as these. &#8220;It&#8217;s eleven o&#8217;clock naow,
and we&#8217;ve got a good piece to go yet, &#8217;fore we&#8217;re
onto the top of old Saddleback.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woods were very still, the air cool and fragrant,
the moss deep and soft under their feet, as
they passed onward and upward.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Climbing, climbing,</div>
<div class="verse">Climbing up Zion&#8217;s hill!</div>
</div></div>

<p>sang the girls, over and over, till the rest caught
the air and joined in heartily, keeping step with
the music. Now they turned an abrupt corner,
and from the summit of a high ledge could look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
far off over the valley, with its piney woods and
peaceful columns of smoke rising here and there.
Loon Pond glistened gayly in the full radiance of
the noon sun; now they attacked a rough natural
stairway of bowlders and fallen trees, the boys
clambering up first, baskets on arm, and then
reaching down to give the others a helping hand.
Pet, who was not used to such rough travelling,
had to stop and rest every few feet; but no face
was sunnier or laugh merrier than hers. Tom
kept as near her side as possible, and gave her
many a helpful lift with his strong arm, over the
worst places. At one time she suddenly remembered
that she had left her handkerchief at the
last halting-place; her cavalier was off before she
could stop him, racing down the steep path and
returning with the missing article in an incredibly
short time.</p>

<p>Still upward. The bowlders were prettily draped
with ferns, which had sunbeams given them to
play with. In the underbrush close by, a flock of
partridges walked demurely and fearlessly along
beside the party, clucking in soft tones their surprise
and curiosity. Tiny brooks crossed the path
and ran off laughing down the hill. Now there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
arose a rushing sound, louder and more steadily
continuous than the wind-dreams in the tree-tops.</p>

<p>It was a cataract, falling some eight feet into a
black pool, covered with little floating rafts of
foam. And now they could see sky between the
trunks of trees ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Tom. &#8220;There&#8217;s the top!&#8221;</p>

<p>But the top was a good walk from there, and
when at last they emerged upon the little rocky
plateau forming the summit, they were both tired
and hungry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rest for thirty minutes,&#8221; proclaimed Mr. Percival.
&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll take the back track.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The back track! Oh-h-h!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about dinner, uncle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just <i>starving</i>, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What time is it? Who&#8217;s got a watch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom turned fiery red at this last question, and
a sober look crossed Pet&#8217;s face; but a moment
later she was merry again.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Please</i>, uncle Will,&#8221; she pleaded, &#8220;mayn&#8217;t we
have lunch before we go down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Please</i>, Miss Pet, turn one of those brooks
upside-down, and bring up a few nice large birch
trees&mdash;and this will be quite a comfortable spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
for dinner! No, dear, we&#8217;ll look all we want to
at this beautiful view, and then we&#8217;ll walk down a
bit&mdash;only a few steps, and not just the way we
came&mdash;to a spot Ruel knows of, where shade, fuel
and fresh water are all at hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The view was indeed lovely: lakes shining here
and there in the woods; far-away villages, with
tiny white church spires; mossy green acres&mdash;thousands
on thousands&mdash;of forest; the dim blue
of Katahdin, to the northeast; overhead, the tenderest
and bluest of midsummer skies.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful that mountain looks!&#8221; said Pet
slowly, from the turfy couch where she had thrown
herself down. &#8220;I wonder if there are strange
Indian stories and legends about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good many, I expect,&#8221; replied Mr. Percival,
baring his forehead to the cool breeze. &#8220;The
Indians have always had a great respect for mountains,
especially where there was some peculiar
formation or feature which impressed their imagination&mdash;the
&#8216;Profile,&#8217; for instance, in the White
Mountains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard the same about the Mount of the
Holy Cross in Colorado,&#8221; added Randolph. &#8220;That
was one of the&mdash;&#8221; he paused and flushed a little,
as if uncertain whether to go on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;Yes, yes,&#8221; laughed uncle Will, guessing from
his manner what he was about to say. &#8220;It&#8217;s that
famous brother of yours again. You ought to
bring him up here sometime, to recite his own
verses. However, you do it very well, for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What has he written about that mountain,
Randolph?&#8221; asked Kittie in a respectful tone that
made the rest laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, only three or four verses,&#8221; said Randolph.
&#8220;You know the Cross is formed by two immense
ravines near the summit of the mountain, where
the ice and snow lie all the year round. These
are the verses.</p>


<p class="center">THE MOUNT OF THE HOLY CROSS.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_142fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">THE MOUNT OF THE HOLY CROSS.</p>

<p>A little pause followed the poem, which Randolph
had repeated in low, quiet tones. At length
it was time to go, and with Ruel for guide once
more, they threaded their way over fallen trees,
around stumps and treacherous ledges, down the
mountain side until, at a distance of perhaps a
furlong from the summit, the guide threw down
his axe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess this&#8217;ll dew,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;This&#8221; was a small cleared spot, some fifty feet
across, along the further side of which ran the
brook, forming half a dozen mimic cataracts. The
woods on all sides were composed of evergreens,
interspersed with clumps of white birch showing
prettily here and there among the darker shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Mr. Percival briskly, &#8220;you and the
girls can start a fire and set the table, Randolph,
while Tom helps Ruel and me to build a camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, a camp! Where shall we make the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Over against that rock, on the lee side of the
clearing, so the smoke sha&#8217;n&#8217;t bother us.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>All hands were soon at work vigorously. Ruel
cut two strong, crotched uprights, and a cross-pole,
which Tom carried to their position near the
brook, as directed by his uncle. A frame-work
was soon erected, and long, slender poles stretched
from the cross-piece back to the ground. Next,
Ruel took his sharp axe, and calling for the rest
to follow, plunged into the woods. In two minutes
they came to a halt in the midst of a group
of fine birches, whose boles shone like veritable
silver.</p>

<p>The guide raised his axe, and laying the keen
edge against the bark of the nearest, as high as
he could reach, drew it steadily downward. The
satiny bark parted on either side at the touch,
asking for fingers to pull it off. Ruel served a
dozen other trees in the same way, and then all
set to work, separating bark from trunk. Tom
found that his was apt to split at every knot, but
by watching his uncle he soon learned to work
more carefully, often using his whole arm to pry
off the bark instead of merely taking hold with
his fingers.</p>

<p>In this way they soon had a lot of splendid
sheets, averaging about four feet wide by five or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
six long. These they rolled into three bundles,
each taking one, and bore them back in triumph
to the camp. They found the table set, fire crackling,
and company waiting with sharpened appetites.
Ruel declared, however, that he must &#8220;git
the bark onto the camp afore he eat a crumb;&#8221;
and the rest helping with a will, the task was soon
accomplished. If Ruel had taken a quiet look at
the sky, and had his own reasons for finishing the
hut&mdash;he kept his forebodings to himself, and
worked on in silence. The sheets of bark were
laid upon the rafters, lapping over each other like
shingles, while other poles were placed on top, to
keep the bark in place. By the aid of stout cord,
side sheets were lashed on roughly, but well
enough for a temporary shelter on a summer day;
and the camp was complete.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we name it?&#8221; asked Kittie.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Camp Ruel&#8217;!&#8221; cried Pet, clapping her hands.
&#8220;Three cheers for Camp Ruel!&#8221; And they were
given lustily, with many additional &#8220;tigers&#8221; and
cat-calls by the boys.</p>

<p>After the more serious part of lunch was disposed
of, the party were comfortably seated in
front of the camp, on rocks and mossy trunks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
Close at hand ran the brook, talking and laughing
busily to itself.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish, Uncle,&#8221; said Bess, taking her favorite
position by his side, &#8220;you&#8217;d tell us a story about
this brook. If you don&#8217;t know any, you can make
it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose,&#8221; said Mr. Percival reflectively, &#8220;I
could tell you about Midget. Only Midget was
such a little fellow, and you boys and girls are so
exceedingly mature nowadays!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Midget, you see, is an odd little fellow.
He has long, light hair, which the other boys on
the street would make fun of if they were not so
fond of him; a rather pale face, though it is
browner now, after half a summer in the country;
and big blue eyes, that seem like bits of sky that
baby Midget caught on his way down from heaven,
ten years ago, and never lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last September, Midget was at Crawford&#8217;s, in
the White Mountains: and one bright morning he
took a walk, all alone, in a path that runs beside a
little brook leaping down the mountain-side near
the hotel. Now there is this curious thing about
Midget&mdash;and that&#8217;s why I began by calling him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
odd&mdash;namely, that when he is alone, all sorts
of things about him begin to talk; at least, he says
they do, with a funny twinkle and a sweet look in
his blue eyes, which make me half believe that the
talk he hears comes from heaven too. At any
rate, Midget had a wonderful report to make of
his walk that morning; and, as nearly as I can
remember, this was his account:</p>

<p>&#8220;He said he had not gone far into the forest
when he was startled, for a moment, by hearing a
group of children, somewhere in the woods, all
laughing and talking together, and having the
merriest time possible. Through the tumult of
their happy cries he could distinguish a woman&#8217;s
voice, so deep and musical and tender that it filled
him with delight. He hurried up the path, turned
the corner where he expected to find them, and
behold! it was the brook itself talking and laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every separate tiny waterfall had its own
special voice, as different from the rest as could
be, but all chiming together musically and joining
with the grander undertone of what most people
suppose to be merely a larger cataract, but which
Midget plainly perceived was a tall, lovely lady,
with flowing, fluttering robes of white.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;And now she was singing to him. How he
listened! Her song, he says, was something like
this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Down from the mosses that grow in the clouds</div>
<div class="verse">My children come dancing and laughing in crowds;</div>
<div class="verse">They dance to the valleys and meadows below,</div>
<div class="verse">And make the grass greener wherever they go.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But they have to go always just in one place,&#8217;
said Midget, addressing the waterfall Lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;That&#8217;s true,&#8217; said the Lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;It can&#8217;t be much fun,&#8217; said Midget.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh, yes!&#8217; said the Lady, merrily, letting a
cool scarf of spray drift over the boy&#8217;s puzzled
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;But I like to go wherever I like,&#8217; said Midget.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;So do my children. They like to go wherever
they&#8217;re sent. They know they&#8217;re doing right,
so long as they do that, and doing right makes
them like it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;H&#8217;m,&#8217; said Midget.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Besides,&#8217; added the Lady, &#8216;once in a while, in
the spring, they&#8217;re allowed to take a run off into
the woods a bit, just for fun.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I should like that,&#8217; said Midget decisively.
&#8216;But who&mdash;who sends them, ma&#8217;am?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>&#8220;&#8216;Ah!&#8217; said the Lady, softly, &#8216;that&#8217;s the best
part of all. It is our Father, who loves us, and
often walks beside his brooks and through the
meadows.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;As she spoke, the end of the white scarf
floated out into the sunshine, and instantly glistened
with fair colors. And at the same moment
the Lady began to sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent">Down from the mountain-top</div>
<div class="indent2">Flows the clear rill,</div>
<div class="indent">Dance, little Never-stop,</div>
<div class="indent2">Doing His will;</div>
<div class="indent">Through the dark shadow-land,</div>
<div class="indent2">Down from the hill,</div>
<div class="indent">To the bright meadow-land,</div>
<div class="indent2">Doing His will,</div>
<div class="verse">Loving and serving and praising Him still.</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Just then a low rumble was heard, far off on
the slopes of Mt. Washington, across the valley.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;There!&#8217; exclaimed Midget, &#8216;I must be going.
Good-by, dear Lady-fall!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Good-by, good-by!&#8217; sang the brook, as Midget
hurried away down the path toward the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;He arrived just in time to escape a wetting.
How it did rain! The lightning glittered and the
thunder rolled until the people huddled about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
big fire in the parlor were fairly scared into
silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Midget, with wide-open eyes, was not a
bit frightened, and kept right on telling me this
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said Pet, &#8220;that&#8217;s lovely. But I suspect
it was a dear old gentleman, and not a small boy,
who heard the waterfall lady sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is there, anyway,&#8221; said uncle Will, &#8220;and I
can show her to you at Crawford&#8217;s, within two
minutes&#8217; walk of the hotel, the very next time we
go there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pet looked puzzled, but said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncle,&#8221; said Kittie, throwing a few strips of
bark on the fire, &#8220;you said something about having
a talk on birches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, dear&mdash;it must be a short one&mdash;how
many kinds of birches do you suppose there are
in our woods?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, two&mdash;no, let me see&mdash;three. White, and
Black&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Yellow,&#8221; put in Tom with an air of wisdom.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Red and Canoe,&#8221; added Mr. Percival, with
a smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>&#8220;So many! What are they good for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Canoes, tents and&mdash;nurses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nurses!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The growth of birches is so rapid that they
are excellent for planting beside other trees which
are less hardy, so that the birches, or &#8216;nurses,&#8217; as
the gardeners call them, may shelter the babies
from extreme heat or cold.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How funny! I knew, of course, that a garden
of young trees was called a nursery!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the real Canoe Birch, which isn&#8217;t common
hereabouts, was formerly much used by the
Indians for canoes and wigwams.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did they make the pieces stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sewed them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thread?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The slender roots of spruces. See!&#8221; And
pulling up a tiny spruce that grew by the rock on
which he sat, he showed them the delicate, tough
rootlets. &#8220;Then,&#8221; he added, &#8220;of course the bark
is very useful for kindling, in the woods. The
White Birch is almost always found with or near
the White Pine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to think of their being &#8216;princes,&#8217; in &#8216;silver
rags&#8217;,&#8221; said Pet. &#8220;I should think there ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
to be a legend about that, among the Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Something in their uncle&#8217;s expression made
them all shout at once, &#8220;There is! There is! O,
please tell it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; laughed Mr. Percival, &#8220;fortunately
for all of us, it isn&#8217;t very long. Tom, keep the
fire going, while you listen. The rest of you may
interrupt and ask questions, whenever you wish.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great, great many years ago, centuries before
Columbus dreamed of America, the Indians say
the country was ruled by a king whose like was
never known before nor since. In an encampment
high up on the slopes of the Rocky Mountains he
lived, and held his royal court. No one knew his
age, but though his beard fell in white waves over
his aged breast, his eye was as bright as an eagle&#8217;s
and his voice strong and wise in every council of
the chiefs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was his name?&#8221; asked Randolph.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was called Manitou the Mighty. In his
reign the Indian people grew prosperous and happy.
So deeply did they love and revere him that it was
quite as common to speak of him as &#8216;father,&#8217; as to
address him as &#8216;king.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said the monarch, when he heard of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
this, &#8216;yes, truly they are my children. They are
all princes, are they not?&mdash;my forest children!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;So the years sped by. The king showed his
age not a whit, save by his snowy locks; and peace
ruled throughout the land.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last Manitou the Mighty called his chiefs,
his &#8216;children,&#8217; together in council.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I am going away,&#8217; he said, &#8216;to far-off countries,
perhaps never to return. But I shall know of my
subjects, and shall leave them a book of laws and
directions, and they shall still be my children, and
I shall be their father and king.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the chiefs hid their faces and went out
to the people with the sorrowful tidings. And
when the next morn broke, the Manitou had vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;A week passed; and now began jealousies,
hatred, avarice, tumults.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t they obey the laws in that book?&#8221;
asked Kittie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in the first place, some professed to
believe that the chiefs made up the story about
the book altogether, and had written the laws
themselves; though a child might have known
that no other than Manitou could possibly have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
thought and written out such glorious and gentle
words as the law book contained. Others pretended
to live by the book, but so twisted the
meaning of its words that the result was worse
than if they had openly transgressed the law.</p>

<p>&#8220;So matters went on, from bad to worse.
Messages arrived now and then from the king,
with pleading and warning words, but in vain.</p>

<p>&#8220;There came a day, in the dead of winter, when
the chiefs met in stormy conclave. Each one
would be king. &#8216;Manitou,&#8217; cried one and another,
&#8216;called me his child, said I was a prince! Who
shall rule over me!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sound of a far-off avalanche, high up
among the ice-fields of the mountains, interrupted
the assembly. Clouds gathered, black and ominous.
Rain-drops fell, hissing, upon the pine-tops
and the wigwams of Manitou&#8217;s wayward children.
A hurricane arose, and swept away into the roaring
flood of the rapidly rising river all the wealth
they had been so eager to gain. The rumbling of
avalanche upon avalanche grew more terrible,
nearer, nearer. The people turned to fly, with
one accord, but it was too late. Behold, the Manitou
stood in their midst, his long white beard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
tossed in the storm, his terrible eyes flashing not
with rage, but with grieved love.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Children, children!&#8217; he cried, in a voice that,
with its sad and awful sweetness, broke their very
hearts for shame and remorse, &#8216;Is it thus that the
princes of our race obey their father and fit themselves
to rule with him in the land beyond the
great waters!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the people bowed their heads and moaned
and threw up their arms wildly, and swayed to and
fro in the storm, and wailed, until&mdash;until&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The girls leaned forward breathlessly. Tom
forgot to heap bark upon the fire. Ruel had
slipped away to the summit, some minutes before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Until there was no longer a prince to be seen,
but only a vast assembly of writhing, tossing,
quivering forest trees, the rain dropping from their
trembling leaves, their branches swaying helplessly
in the wind which moaned sadly through the forest.
Only one trace remained of their former greatness.
Their bark, unlike that of every other tree, was
silvery white, and hung in tatters about them&mdash;as
you have seen them to-day, along this mountain
side. For since that hour the beggared princes
have wandered far and wide, still wearing their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
silver rags, still weeping and moaning when the
storms are at their highest, and they recall that
awful day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pet drew a long breath. &#8220;And Manitou, what
became of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He still reigns, the legend goes, in the bright
land beyond the great waters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And must the princes always be birches?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Pet, that is the most beautiful part of the
tradition. By patient continuance in well-doing,
by self-sacrifice, by living for others, the poor trees
may at last make themselves worthy to see the
king once more as his children, leaving the withered
tree-house behind. But not until life is done, and
well done.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you see, every white birch is eager to give
its bark for fuel and protection, which is nearly all
it can do, save to watch over the young trees of
the forest, as I have told you, to shield them from
harm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a long time for a birch to wait, sometimes
many, many years before even a little child
will strip off one of its tattered shreds and laugh
for delight at the pretty bit of silver in its hand,
little dreaming of the prince whose garment it is;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
but the tree quivers with joy at the thought that
it has made one of these little ones happy for even
a moment, for so it has become more worthy to
meet the king.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mr. Percival finished, Ruel returned from
the summit of Saddleback.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better get the things into camp, and
foller &#8217;em yourselves. There&#8217;s a storm comin&#8217;.
The wind&#8217;s jest haowlin&#8217;, over in the birches on
the west side of the maounting.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br />


<small>THE STORM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was fortunate that Ruel made that little exploring
expedition, all by himself, for the
storm was evidently rising fast. The sun went
out; clouds rolled up over the western sky until
it seemed as if evening were coming on; the forest
was perfectly silent, except for a troubled rustling
of the birches, the plash of the brook, and a dull,
far-off sound like the waves of a distant ocean.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival drove all the party into the camp,
and Ruel busied himself in laying on extra poles
and closing every crack where the rain might beat
in at the sides.</p>

<p>Kittie and Bess had been out in a storm before
with their uncle, so they didn&#8217;t much mind it.
Pet nestled up close beside them, and waited with
wide-open eyes, hardly knowing whether to be
more frightened or delighted at the prospect.
Tom was by far the most nervous of the party,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
fidgeting about, begging Ruel to come inside, and
behaving so queerly that Bess declared with a
laugh that she believed he felt like the princes,
when the Manitou was coming. As she spoke
there was an ominous and prolonged roll of thunder,
and the tree-tops bent under the first rush of
the on-coming tempest.</p>

<p>Tom started and turned white to the very lips,
but answered never a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother the boy,&#8221; said Mr. Percival
kindly. &#8220;See&mdash;the storm is really upon us now!&#8221;</p>

<p>A glittering flash of lightning accompanied his
words, and was followed by a rattling discharge of
thunder. Up to this time, not a drop of rain had
fallen, but now it began to patter like bullets on
the dry leaves, the fire, and, loudest of all, on the
bark roof above them.</p>

<p>Ruel crept in at last, and all seven curled up in
as small compass, as far from the half-open front,
as possible. How it did pour! It came down
in torrents, in sheets, with an uninterrupted roar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire&#8217;s gittin&#8217; tired,&#8221; remarked Ruel, after
about two minutes of this; and sure enough, nothing
was left but a few charred brands, steaming
sulkily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>The lightning and thunder now came almost
simultaneously, flashing and booming until the
very sky above them seemed ablaze.</p>

<p>After a few attempts at conversation the young
folks gave it up, and remained silent. Pet was
very much frightened and hid her face on Kittie&#8217;s
shoulder, giving a little involuntary cry whenever
an unusually loud peal of thunder crashed overhead.</p>

<p>For a full half-hour the fury of the storm lasted.
Then it rolled away over the hills and left only a
light rain falling. It was still far too wet for them
to leave their shelter, but the party recovered their
spirits, and Ruel even managed to coax a new fire
to blaze on the ruins of the old, with the aid of
some dry bark and sticks he had prudently stowed
away at the first alarm. The cheerful blaze and
hissing crackle of the fire were reassuring, and
voices soon rose again, as merrily as ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;What time do you s&#8217;pose it is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three o&#8217;clock!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, aren&#8217;t you <i>awfully</i> stiff? Do let me move
my foot a little!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kit, let&#8217;s have a song. That one about the
pines.&#8221; This was from Tom.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>Kittie accordingly sang the following lines, to a
bright little air. They were written by Randolph&#8217;s
brother, she admitted with a blush and a laugh;
the tune was in Whiting&#8217;s Third Music Reader:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="indent5">Rock him to sleep to-night!</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Kittie&#8217;s voice was a soft contralto, and though
not strong, was very sweet. There were hand-clapping
and thanks in profusion; then a unanimous
cry for a story&mdash;something about a thunder-shower.</p>

<p>These young people, be it said, always called on
their uncle Will for a story upon any subject, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
as much confidence as you would have in ordering
roast beef or cake at a hotel, without looking at
the bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the story-teller, after a moment&#8217;s
reflection, &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you about Patsy&#8217;s
Prayer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was a sultry afternoon in August. In the
government offices, from the Alleghanies to Eastport,
men were busily making up weather reports
of what promised to be the hottest day of the season.
Pretty soon, some of them began to find difficulty
in managing their telegraph wires; the air
seemed charged with electricity; the men took
their observations, and worked harder than ever.
At length the sergeant in charge of one of the
largest and busiest stations glanced up quickly
from a bunch of dispatches he had just read, examined
the barometer with a great deal of care,
made a few notes in a huge memorandum book,
and scratched off a message, which was handed at
once to the telegraph operator sitting a few feet
away. In five minutes the government weather
officials throughout New England knew that a
dangerous storm-centre was rapidly moving toward
them; and up went their signals accordingly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;The Brookville farmers had heard nothing of
all this, but they looked at the sky knowingly, and
hurried a little at their work. At the quiet old
Coburn house the &#8216;women folks&#8217; were up-stairs
asleep, in the lull between dinner and supper; the
men were afield, working with all their might.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I dunno,&#8217; said Patsy, &#8216;but I&#8217;ll take a bit av a
walk wid Shock. Sure, they won&#8217;t mind ef I&#8217;m
back before tay.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Patsy Dolan and his four-year-old sister Shock
(probably so-called in reference to the usual state
of her hair) were Boston children, who had been
sent into the country for a week by the Missionary
Society. Patsy himself was only nine, and knew
nothing of the world outside of his native city.
As he stepped out of the back door of the old
house, leading his little sister, he instinctively
glanced over his shoulder. Then he laughed a
little at himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;No p&#8217;leecemen here!&#8217; he said aloud, with a
chuckle. &#8216;A feller can kape onto the grass all he
wants.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was very slow walking, for Shock was not
an accomplished pedestrian, even on brick sidewalks;
and here the ground was very uneven.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Besides, it must be confessed that her temper was
rather uncertain, and on this particular hot afternoon
she constantly required soothing. But Patsy
cared little for this. He had been used to taking
care of his baby sister almost ever since she was
born, and he patiently submitted to her whims,
now stopping to disentangle her little bare feet
from briery vines, now lifting her in his arms and
bearing her over an unusually rough spot. So
they went on, across the field, over a tiny brook,
through a narrow belt of woods, and out upon an
open pasture, which bulged up here and there like
a great quilt, with patches of moss and grass, and
with round juniper bushes for buttons. At least,
this was the image that vaguely suggested itself
to Patsy as he tugged his hot little burden along
farther and farther away from home.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suddenly he stopped and looked up.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Sure, it&#8217;s comin&#8217; on night,&#8217; said he. &#8216;The
sun&#8217;s gone entirely, it is. We must be goin&#8217;
back.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Shock had reached the limit of feminine
endurance, and declined, with all the firmness of
her nature, this unexpected move. She objected
to that extent that she sat down hard on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
ground, and wailed with heat and weariness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patsy was a little nonplussed, for it was growing
very dark. He was acquainted with Shock&#8217;s
resources of resistance, and hesitated to call them
forth. While he deliberated he winked and winced
at the same moment; a broad drop of water had
struck full upon his upturned face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Come out o&#8217; that, Shockie,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;we
<i>must</i> go now. The rain is a-comin&#8217;!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thereupon Shock made her next move, which
was to lie flat on her back and cry louder. She
hadn&#8217;t begun to kick yet, but Patsy knew she
would.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another great drop fell, and another. It grew
bright about them, then suddenly darker than ever,
as if somebody had lighted the gas and blown it
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! Rumble, rumble, boom, bo-o-m&mdash;bo-o-m!
Patsy pricked up his ears; for even a
city boy knows thunder, though it is half drowned
by the roar of the wagons and pavements. Without
more words he dived at Shock, and bore her
away struggling, across the pasture. It had grown
so dark that he could not well see where to put his
feet, so he fell once or twice, bruising his wrists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
badly. But he managed to tumble in a way to save
Shock, so it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a moaning and rustling sound in the
far-off forests that notched the horizon on every
side. Then the wind and the rain joined hands,
and rushed forward wildly with a mighty roar that
appalled the boy, staggering under his heavy
load.</p>

<p>&#8220;He halted, and crouched in a little hollow.
The voice of the storm now quite swept away the
feeble crying of the exhausted child in his arms.
As he cast a wild look about him, like a hunted
rabbit, a brilliant flash of lightning showed for an
instant what promised a refuge which, slight though
it might be, seemed blessed compared with this bare
field where the storm was searching for him with
its terrible, gleaming eyes and hollow voice. If he
could only reach that spot, Patsy thought, he would
feel easy. It was a single huge elm-tree, like those
on the Common, only standing quite alone in the
pasture. It would be such a nice place in a
thunder-storm&mdash;poor Patsy!</p>

<p>&#8220;A dim recollection of the prayers the mission
people had taught him, came into his mind. But
he couldn&#8217;t think of anything but, &#8216;Now I lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
me,&#8217; so he concluded to try for the tree first, and
say his prayers after he got there.</p>

<p>&#8220;He lifted Shock once more in his aching arms,
and started.</p>

<p>&#8220;But God heard his little heart-prayer above all
the booming of the thunder; and this was how He
answered it.</p>

<p>&#8220;The boy was getting on bravely, when Shock,
whose fright was renewed by the motion, gave a
sudden struggle. His foot slipped,&mdash;down, down
he went, into a gully that had lain, unseen, across
his path. The bushes broke his fall, but he lay a
moment quite breathless and discouraged. But it
would not do to remain so; for there was Shock,
by no means injured, and crying lustily. Patsy
picked himself up, and felt about him until his hand
struck the side of a large rock. There was a
dry place under one side, which projected slightly.
He reached for Shock, and deposited her in this
sheltered spot, on some leaves the wind had blown
in there last autumn. He wished he could get in,
too; but there was barely room for one.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Told, told,&#8217; moaned Shock, shivering, and
drawing up her little limbs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Without an instant&#8217;s hesitation Patsy threw off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
his wet jacket, and tucked it round her. In three
minutes he knew by her stillness and regular
breathing that she was asleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he began to be cold&mdash;very cold himself.
Every whizzing rain-drop seemed like ice, striking
on his bare feet and bruised hands. If he could
only have that jacket, or put his feet in with Shock
under it just for a minute!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I don&#8217;t s&#8217;pose she&#8217;d know,&#8217; he said to himself,
with chattering teeth. &#8216;But I won&#8217;t&mdash;no, I won&#8217;t.
A feller must look out fer his sister.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he remembered the prayers again; and
the best thing he could think of was the psalm he
had been taught only the Sunday before. He cuddled
up as close to the rock as he could, and began:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Lord is my shepherd&mdash;I shall&mdash;I shall&mdash;&#8217;
Here he forgot, and had to commence again.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Lord is my shepherd, I shall&mdash;not&mdash;want
nothin&#8217;. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures&mdash;&#8217;
Patsy paused, and peered into the darkness
doubtfully. &#8216;I dunno,&#8217; he said, &#8216;as I want&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He never finished that sentence. And this was
what interrupted him. A great shimmering, glittering
flash, that filled all the air, and at the very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
same moment an awful crash&mdash;and the storm
beat down upon a little white face, upturned silently
to the black sky.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hallo&mdash;hallo&mdash;o&mdash;o!&#8217; The shout rang out
clear and strong on the evening air. Far off
among the hills the last rumble of thunder was dying
away.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;They must have gone along here,&#8217; cried
Farmer Coburn; &#8216;hold your lantern, Tom&mdash;see,
there&#8217;s their tracks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Hallo! hallo&mdash;o&mdash;o!&mdash;Why, what&mdash;&#8217;
What makes Farmer Coburn stop so suddenly, and
then dart forward with one of the lanterns? A
wee sound, and a sad, sad sight. The sound is the
waking voice of Shock, who turns uneasily on her
bed of dry leaves; the sight is a little white face,
upturned to the star-dotted sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;How those rough men bent over the little fellow,
the tears running over their cheeks, as they
noticed the jacket!</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;He&#8217;s alive!&#8217; shouts Tom, with a half-sob, catching
the boy up in his arms, &#8216;he&#8217;s only stunned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
The lightnin&#8217; must have struck round here somewhere,
just near enough to knock him over. He&#8217;s
comin&#8217; to now!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Patsy comes. He soon as he can talk,
he tells them about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Why,&#8217; he says, straightening up in Tom&#8217;s arms
(Shock is sound asleep again, with her tousled
head bobbing on Farmer Coburn&#8217;s shoulder at
every step)&mdash;&#8216;why, there&#8217;s the tree, sure&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;The men looked, and turned away with a shudder.
The noble elm would never again lift its green
boughs toward the sky. Scorching, rending, shattering,
the red lightning had torn its way down the
huge trunk, throwing the fragments on every side,
and leaving the twisted fibres thrust into the air,
white and bare, in a way that told of the terrible
force that had had the mastery of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Patsy thought it all over very soberly. He remembered
his prayer and his psalm.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;I dunno&mdash;&#8217; he said.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As uncle Will ceased, his auditors were very
still; thinking, perhaps, how they too had been
kept safely from the fury of the tempest on the
lonely mountain-side.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Ruel now looked out and announced that the
storm was over; and indeed there was hardly need
of telling it, for the sunbeams came dancing down
to the little birch camp with the same story. Out
poured the young folks, the girls holding their
skirts daintily from contact with the dripping undergrowth,
of which, fortunately, there was not an
abundance. The brook was much higher than before,
and laughed and spoke in deeper tones; as if,
like many a young human life, it had grown old
during the storm, and was no longer a child.</p>

<p>The whole party now &#8220;broke camp&#8221; and turned
their faces homeward. Their feet they could not
keep dry, of course; but they were not far from
The Pines, and they knew that aunt Puss was waiting
for them with dry socks and a good supper.</p>

<p>Down the path they ran, filling the air with their
shouts and laughter. Ruel came last, with a huge
bundle of bark, made from the sheets they had
used on the hut.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use to leave it there,&#8221; he said, in answer to
Randolph&#8217;s laughing question. &#8220;In a week &#8217;twould
jest be good fer spiders to live in&mdash;all curled up
in the sun. Daown &#8217;t the house we c&#8217;n use it fer
your uncle&#8217;s fires, this tew months.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br />


<small>THE GREAT BASE-BALL MATCH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE was great excitement at The Pines.
Randolph and Tom had practised several
times with the Readville Base-Ball Nine, as I have
said, Randolph taking the lead, finally, of the whole
club. On a certain afternoon, about a week after
the mountain tramp, a dozen or more boys were
gathered on the little open plot of ground which
the Readville people called the &#8220;Common,&#8221; eagerly
discussing a subject which was interesting enough
to make their eyes sparkle and their voices all
chime in together as they talked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, hold on, fellows,&#8221; exclaimed one of the
tallest, raising his hand for silence. &#8220;We may as
well do this business up squarely on the spot. I&#8217;ll
read the challenge, if you&#8217;ll all keep still.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys threw themselves on the ground, and
in various easy attitudes prepared to listen.</p>

<p>Randolph, who was speaker, remained standing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
and drawing a paper from his pocket, read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;The Jamestown High School Nine hereby challenge the Readville
Nine to a game of base-ball, to be played on Readville
Common, on the afternoon of next Saturday, at three o&#8217;clock&mdash;&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Next Saturday!&#8221; interjected one of the listeners.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;&mdash;five innings to count a game if stopped by rain. League rules
to be followed.</p>

<p class="right">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Hiram Black</span>,<br />
&#8220;Captain Jamestown B. B. Nine.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>A chorus of cheers and cat-calls broke out immediately
on the conclusion of the challenge; but
Randolph raised his hand once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;The question is, Shall we accept? Those in
favor say &#8216;Aye!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>A tremendous shout rent the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those opposed, &#8216;No!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Dead silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a vote. Now for positions and players.&#8221;</p>

<p>So far, there had been no dispute as to Randolph&#8217;s
authority. He had such a pleasant way of
getting on with the boys that they followed his
lead willingly.</p>

<p>When they came to the choice of positions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
however, there was a little more feeling. As to
first, second and third base, the matter was easy
enough. There were two fellows who played shortstop
well, but they were warm friends, and each
was ready to yield to the other.</p>

<p>Dick Manning was acknowledged to be the best
pitcher in town, having a &#8220;drop twist&#8221; which he
had gained by days of practice, at odd moments,
behind his father&#8217;s barn, and upon which he
greatly prided himself in a modest way.</p>

<p>Up to this point all went smoothly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, as to catcher,&#8221; said Randolph. &#8220;I know
it&#8217;s a show place, and I don&#8217;t want to put myself
forward. But it&#8217;s an important game, and I <i>think</i>
I understand Dick&#8217;s delivery better than the rest
of you. Bert Farnum is a tip-top hand behind the
bat, I know; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Randolph hesitated as he saw Bert look down
and dig his heel into the ground, half sullenly.</p>

<p>Bert was a graceful player, a strong hitter and
swift thrower. His chief trouble was uncertainty.
You couldn&#8217;t depend either on his temper or his
nerve in a closely-contested game. Randolph knew
this, and now endeavored to smooth over matters
by suggesting that Bert should play centre-field at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
first, and come in for a change during the close of
the game, if necessary.</p>

<p>Right and left-fielders were easily appointed,
and the boys seized their bats and balls for a
couple of hours&#8217; practice.</p>

<p>Bert excused himself gruffly, and wandered
down by the river alone. He wanted catcher&#8217;s
position for that game, and felt defrauded by his
captain.</p>

<p>All the girls from the institute would be sure to
come and cluster around the in-field, while the
centre-fielder would be stationed away off by himself,
with, perhaps, not a single chance to win applause.</p>

<p>Bert&#8217;s father was one of the wealthiest men in
town, and the boy was used to having his own way.</p>

<p>Only yesterday, a fine new catcher&#8217;s mask had
come up from the city. Of course, he had meant
to lend it freely to the nine in all their games; but
now he resolved he would say nothing about it.
The old mask was nearly worn out, and, if struck
at certain points, was sure to hurt the wearer.</p>

<p>If Randolph Percival was so particular about
catching, he could wear the old thing, for all Bert
cared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>Having gone so far as this, the unhappy boy
suddenly hit upon another scheme to obtain his revenge.
He stopped short and scowled darkly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; he said to himself; then turned
and walked homeward, meditating all the way on
the surest means to accomplish his purpose.</p>

<p>It was no less than to bring about the defeat of
his own companions. How he succeeded will be
seen.</p>

<p>There were only four days before the afternoon
set for the match, and uncle Will found his young
folks so full of the coming game that they could
think of nothing else. Tom, who made a lively
third base, seemed for the time to have forgotten
his troubles, and entered heartily into the sport.
Dick Manning came over from the village every
afternoon, and tried his favorite &#8220;delivery&#8221; with
Randolph, who practised catching whenever he
could get anybody to throw balls at him. He was
continually enticing little Bridget out to perform
this duty, which she did with such earnestness and
energy that he had to fairly beg for mercy.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_176fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">KITTIE AT WORK.</p>

<p>It was wonderful to see how the little North
Street waif expanded and grew, mentally, physically
and morally, in this pure air, and under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
gentle teaching of aunt Puss, who had received her
with open arms. The girl&#8217;s sallow cheeks grew
plump and wholesome to look at; her dull eyes
brightened; she worked, or tried to, all day, and
slept soundly all night. She even learned to play
a little, which was the hardest of all. When Randolph
had gravely suggested that she could make
herself useful by throwing a ball at him, out in the
orchard, she accepted the proposition in perfect
good faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure I wull,&#8221; said Bridget, taking the ball from
Randolph&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>Her throws, he found, were just wild enough
to give him practice; while their velocity left nothing
to be desired. She flung the ball at him as if
she were determined to annihilate him on the spot.
It was only when he rolled over in the grass, laughing
and crying for mercy, that a bewildered smile
came into her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure ye tould me fire hard, thin,&#8221; she said
slowly, tossing back her long hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I did, Bridget. And if ever I get back to
Boston, I&#8217;ll propose your name as champion pitcher
in the League team!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little Irish girl having retired, Pet, who just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
then came up, offered to take her place; but her
services were gratefully declined. Pet&#8217;s soft but
erratic tosses were already only too familiar to the
boys.</p>

<p>Well, the great day came at last. The wagon
was filled, immediately after dinner, and the whole
party, with uncle Will at the reins, drove over
to Readville. They stationed themselves on the
edge of the base-ball grounds, where Randolph
said they could obtain a good view, and their team
would not be in the way of the players. The air
was warm, but a gentle westerly breeze, mountain-cooled,
prevented discomfort from the heat.</p>

<p>By two o&#8217;clock, groups of young people, in twos
and threes, began to stroll toward the Common.</p>

<p>Already a number of players were on hand engaged
in vigorous practice, their jaunty uniforms
showing prettily against the green, closely-cropped
ball-field. The Jamestown nine wore blue stockings
and gray suits; the &#8220;Readvilles,&#8221; white, with
red stockings.</p>

<p>The crowd increased. At about a quarter before
three, two of the players, one from each nine, separated
at a distance from the Common, and came to
it from different directions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>One of them was the captain of the &#8220;Jamestowns,&#8221;
a rough, black-eyed fellow, whom nobody
liked, but who was a fine player. The other was
Bert Farnum.</p>

<p>As the hour for the game drew near, the excitement
in the Percival wagon was at fever heat. Tom
and his cousins were in the field, practising, and
the girls watched eagerly every play the two made.
Randolph wore the old mask, and worked steadily
with Dick, a little to one side. Quite a crowd of
Jamestown people had come over to witness the
game and cheer for their nine, who were considerably
heavier than their opponents. The knowing
ones among the spectators gave their opinion that
if the &#8220;Readvilles&#8221; were to win, they would have
to do it by spryness in the field; the &#8220;Jamestowns&#8221;
would bat more effectively, and throw
well. Bert Farnum was spoken of as a splendid
thrower, on whom much depended.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say that Boston fellow, Percival, is a master
hand,&#8221; said one broad-shouldered young farmer
who had sauntered up within hearing of the wagon-party.
&#8220;Jest look at him now, practisin&#8217;!
He ketches them swift, twisty balls like clockwork!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>Kitty and Bess pinched each other, and their
faces glowed with pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; whispered Kittie confidentially to
Pet, &#8220;but I like to hear somebody else say it, just
the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further conversation was suddenly hushed by
a movement among the players. Three o&#8217;clock
had arrived, and in presence of the umpire the two
captains tossed up a cent. The &#8220;Readvilles&#8221; won
the toss, and sent their opponents to the bat.</p>

<p>As the red-stockings walked past them into the
field, the Jamestown captain winked at Bert, who
nodded slightly in return, blushing at the same
time and glancing over his shoulder to see if he
was observed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Low ball&mdash;play!&#8221; called the umpire.</p>

<p>Dick Manning drew himself up, looking carelessly
about the field; then suddenly, with a swift
movement, sent the white ball whizzing directly
over the plate, about two feet from the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;One strike!&#8221; shouted the umpire.</p>

<p>The Jamestowner looked surprised, and before
he had gathered himself for the next ball it was
past him again and in the hands of Randolph, who
waited till the umpire called &#8220;Strike, two!&#8221; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
then ran up behind the bat, adjusting the old mask
over his face.</p>

<p>The next two balls delivered were wide. The
third was just right, and the Jamestowner hit with
all his force. It soared far up in the air, toward
the centre-field.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bert! Bert Farnum!&#8221; cried Randolph as two
or three of the fielders started for the ball.</p>

<p>Bert ran, and stretched out his hands&mdash;a little
awkwardly, his friends thought. The next moment
the ball struck the ground six feet away, and the
striker was safe on second base.</p>

<p>A prolonged &#8220;Oh-h-h!&#8221; came involuntarily from
the crowd, and Bert returned with a sullen air to
his station, after fielding the ball.</p>

<p>The Jamestowns now succeeded in getting the
striker and another man round the bases. Randolph
put out the third, by running a long distance
under a foul fly, almost reaching the wagon before
he secured it.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Readvilles&#8221; were retired without making
a run. Score, 2 to 0, in favor of Jamestown. The
girls clenched their hands in silence, while the
Jamestown people on the other side of the grounds
cheered lustily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>The game proceeded, and was contested hotly
at every point. The visitors seemed possessed
with but one ambition, and that was to knock the
ball down to centre. Time and again it started in
that direction, but dropped short, or into the hands
of one of the other fielders.</p>

<p>At last the ninth inning was reached. The
score was a tie&mdash;eight to eight. &#8220;Jamestown&#8221;
came to the bat, and two men went out in quick
succession, one on afoul fly, the other at first base.
The third striker got the ball just where he wanted
it, and sent it high up in Bert&#8217;s direction.</p>

<p>Now, Bert had already begun to repent of the
treacherous part he was playing. Here was a
chance to redeem himself. He made a desperate
run backward for the ball, but tripped and fell just
as it was coming to his hands. Again he heard
that long note of dismay from his friends. The
sound nerved him. Leaping to his feet, he darted
after the ball like a deer, and, picking it up lightly,
as it rolled, faced about. The runner was making
the round of the bases, amid the shouts and jeers
of the Jamestown people who had come over to see
the game.</p>

<p>Bert gathered himself for a mighty effort, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
drawing back his arm, threw the ball with all his
strength. Randolph was waiting for it eagerly, with
his foot on the home-plate. It seemed impossible
that the ball could get there in time, and the Jamestowners
cheered more lustily than ever, as the blue
stockings went flying along the base-line toward
home; but still more swiftly came the ball, sent
with unerring aim from Bert&#8217;s far-away arm.</p>

<p>Just a wee fraction of a second before the runner
touched the plate the ball settled into Randolph&#8217;s
hands, which swung round like lightning,
and Jamestown was out&mdash;score, 8 to 8.</p>

<p>On coming in with his side for their last turn at
the bat, Bert found himself all at once a hero.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never was such a throw seen on the grounds!&#8221;
they said; and poor Bert hung his head, and
answered not a word.</p>

<p>The spectators were now fairly breathless with
excitement. The score tied, and Readville at the
bat for the last time.</p>

<p>Tom, whose turn it was, took his place amid
encouraging shouts from his side. After a nervous
&#8220;strike,&#8221; he made a good hit that carried him to
second, where he seemed likely to be left, as the
next two at the bat struck easy flies, and went out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
It was Bert&#8217;s turn. Heretofore he had purposely
struck out every time he came to the bat. Now
his hands clenched the stick firmly, and he braced
his feet as if he meant business. The crowd saw
the slight movement, and cheered to encourage
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike one!&#8221; called the umpire, as the ball
flew over the plate a little higher than Bert wanted
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Strike two!&#8221;</p>

<p>Still not just right. Bert waited calmly. The
crowd were silent, and looked downcast. Suddenly
they gave a wild cheer. Hats were flung into the
air, and handkerchiefs waved. Bert had made a
terrific hit, sending the ball far beyond the rightfielder.
In another moment Tom had reached
home, and scored the winning run&mdash;score, Readvilles,
9; Jamestowns, 8.</p>

<p>The great match was finished.</p>

<small>HUNTED TO EARTH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">AS soon as the excitement over the base-ball
match had died away, Tom&#8217;s moodiness
returned. It was now near the end of August,
and the little party at the Pines began to show
signs of breaking up. Kittie and her sister, with
Tom, were to meet their father and mother at Portland
on the twenty-fifth of the month, returning to
Boston in season for school. Randolph, too, was
due in the Latin School ranks on September fifth;
Pet received a letter from her family, telling her to
join them at the mountains at about the same
time.</p>

<p>As the remaining days of vacation rapidly dwindled,
the fun, on the contrary, increased. Bert
Farnum had a long talk with Randolph, shortly
after the match, and made a clean breast of his
treachery, telling him how he had suffered from remorse
at the unmanly part he had played in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
earlier part of the great game, and how repentant
he was for the whole affair. The result of this confession
was that the two boys became firm friends,
and Bert, in company with Dick Manning and a
good-natured sister Polly, often joined the Bostonians
in their mountain tramps, hay-cart rides, and
other good times.</p>

<p>Old Sebattis and his wife were reported as encamped
near the county road, fifteen miles away.
Of course, nothing had been heard of the watch,
the secret of its whereabouts being locked in the
breast of one unhappy boy.</p>

<p>One hot, sultry afternoon, when the rest had
gone off to the woods on a picnic, Tom started
alone for his favorite hiding-place in the cliff near
the alder run. He walked slowly down the path,
looking neither to right nor left, and seeing nothing
of the beauty of flower and bird and tree about
him. He was saying over and over to himself,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it! I won&#8217;t stand it any longer! I&#8217;ll do
it this very afternoon!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made his way across the field, down through
the pasture, and along the dry brook-channel to the
drooping beech-tree. Glancing about him carelessly,
from mere habit, he swung himself up to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
trunk and clambered into the snug nook among the
ferns.</p>

<p>Had he, for once, scrutinized his surroundings
more earnestly, and peered around the corner of
the large fallen bowlder at the foot of the cliff, he
might have seen two dark eyes fastened upon him,
from among the undergrowth. Their gaze was so
full of spite and low cunning that it would have
been well for Tom had he caught a glimpse of them
and sprung away at once. But without a thought
of danger, his mind concentrated on one object
alone, he reached his high perch, and seated himself
on a rock to regain his breath.</p>

<p>Already his face had a better expression than it
had worn for weeks. His lips were set, as if with
a firm and noble resolve; his eyes flashed with the
light that always shines full on the face that is
turned toward the Right. It was plain that Tom
had made up his mind at last, and was happier for
it, whatever might be the consequences.</p>

<p>After resting a few moments, he carefully removed
a few odd bits of stone and moss from the
mouth of a crevice in the rock, and drew out Pet&#8217;s
watch. He at once examined it thoroughly, holding
it to his ear as he had done on a previous occasion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he to himself, with great satisfaction,
&#8220;it&#8217;s all right. One good rub, to brighten it up,
and in fifteen minutes it shall be in uncle Will&#8217;s
hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>He drew a piece of flannel from his pocket, and
polished the case of the pretty little timepiece, inside
and out, until it shone so that he could see his
own face reflected in the gold. Then he placed it
carefully in an inner pocket, and rising to his feet
with a sigh of relief, stepped down toward the
slanting trunk of the beech, on which he was prepared
to descend, as usual.</p>

<p>He had no sooner stooped for this purpose, however,
when he started back with an involuntary cry
of alarm.</p>

<p>About six feet below him, staring upward with a
face full of malignant cunning, was Sebattis Megone,
in the very act of seizing the swaying limbs
of the tree to mount the ledge. The moment he
saw that he was detected, he released his grasp on
the boughs, and stood still, looking up at Tom with
an ugly grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; he grunted, Indian-fashion. &#8220;What
boy do on rocks? What he want in woods?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom glanced about him hastily. If the man had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
evil intentions, there was no way of escape. It
seemed as if he could feel the little watch beating
against his own heart. He tried to answer with an
appearance of carelessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I come here most every day and read,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s cool in the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What climb up high for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a good place here to sit down. I like
to be alone, sometimes, don&#8217;t you, Sebattis?&#8221;</p>

<p>The good-will of the tone was lost on the Indian,
who evidently knew more than he cared to tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where Gold-hair&#8217;s watch?&#8221; he asked suddenly
and fiercely, to throw Tom off his guard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was lost that day she fell into the lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yis. Me remember. See!&#8221; and Sebattis
scowled darkly as he laid his hand on a scar where
the broken window, probably, had cut his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry you were hurt,&#8221; began Tom, nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know where watch is. Give me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think I know about it?&#8221; Tom
wanted to gain time. His only hope was that
some one might stray down into the woods within
reach of his voice. As to the cliff, he knew well
enough, for he had often examined it, and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
tried the feat in fun once or twice, that it could
not be scaled. From the hollow where he stood,
the face of the rock slanted outward above him,
rendering escape in that direction out of the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you no give me, I come up and take watch&mdash;maybe
hurt you!&#8221; snarled the Indian in his
guttural tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on,&#8221; said poor Tom, at his wit&#8217;s end;
more anxious, now, for the safety of the watch than
for himself. &#8220;It will be easier for me to come
down than for you to climb way up here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You come then&mdash;quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was plainly growing angry, and laid his
hand on his knife as he spoke, by way of menace.</p>

<p>But Tom had no idea of coming down. Instead
of that, he suddenly drew back a step, and shouted
at the top of his lungs,</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Help! Help! Tim, uncle Percival! Help!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the Indian seemed taken aback
at this unlooked-for move, glancing fearfully over
his shoulder as if he expected to hear Tim&#8217;s sturdy
footfalls. Then his rage got the better of him, and,
grasping the branches once more, he began to
clamber upward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>Fortunately, being rather stout, he could not
manage the ascent quite so nimbly as Tom. The
boy, pale as death, sprang back into the furthest
corner of the cavity, intending to fight to the last,
in defence of the watch, the loss of which had
brought such sorrow to Pet, and such disgrace and
unhappiness to his own summer vacation at his
uncle&#8217;s.</p>

<p>What would have been the result of such a struggle,
I cannot tell. The Indian was armed, and the
boy would have been but a baby in his hands, if the
issue depended upon mere strength. But at this
moment a strange thing happened.</p>

<p>When Tom drew back into the hollow formed by
the angle of the rocks, he crowded in among the
ferns and thick moss further than he had ever been
before. As he did so, he threw one despairing
look about him for a weapon. What seemed to be
a loose stone caught his eye. It was covered with
many years&#8217; growth of lichens, but it came up
easily in his hand. As he was stooping to raise it,
what was his astonishment to find beneath it a dark
opening into what appeared a sort of inner cave,
the mouth of which had been concealed by rubbish.</p>

<p>With the instinct of a hunted animal, as he heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
the boughs of the beech-tree creak under the weight
of his enemy, he tore aside the rocks and moss
which were easily dislodged and in a moment more
he was in the hole, pulling the largest stone within
reach over the mouth of his strange retreat as he
disappeared within it.</p>

<p>His first sensation was one of relief. The Indian,
he knew, would hesitate about entering a trap
like this, where his unseen foe might spring upon
him from any side. Already his footsteps were
heard, on the stones above, and his short, surprised
grunt when he found his victim had sunk into the
ground like a mole. He was beginning to cautiously
remove the rubbish from the opening, when
Tom thought it was time to beat a further retreat.</p>

<p>At first, plunging suddenly into darkness out of
the sunny afternoon, he had been able to see nothing.
Now the few rays of light that entered enabled
him to distinguish the nature of his surroundings.
He found that he was in a little rocky chamber,
perhaps ten feet square and half as many high,
partly natural and partly cleared by the hand of
man; as he could tell by the regular arrangement
of stones here and there. At the further end was
a blacker space than anywhere else. He moved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
across the cave, and found that this was the entrance
to an inner tunnel or passage-way, apparently
leading to still further recesses. The Indian had
now ceased work, and Tom felt more nervous than
when he could hear him scratching and digging at
the mouth of the cave. There seemed nothing for
it but to keep on, in the black passage, where the
darkness, at least, would favor him. He had to get
down on his hands and knees, as this inner opening
was less than three feet in diameter; and in
this way he crawled ahead, into the depths of the
little cave.</p>

<p>Up to this moment he had never stopped to reason
out the possible cause for such a queer, underground
chamber. Now it suddenly flashed upon
him that it must be the secret passage-way that his
uncle had told about; for although Tom had not
been in the room when Mr. Percival had described
this ancient provision for escape in case of sudden
attack, he had heard his sisters speak of it afterward.
Where it came out, he did not know; but
the thought that he must be moving toward the
house gave him new courage.</p>

<p>Making as little noise as possible, he crept along
the passage-way, hoping every minute that it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
expand to a size sufficient to allow of his walking
erect. After a short halt for rest, he started on
again, having made such good progress that he believed
he must be half-way to the house. Two or
three times he bumped his head, but he paid little
attention to bruises. So far he was safe, with the
watch in his pocket, from his ugly pursuer.</p>

<p>He had not gone a dozen feet, however, when he
came to a second halt, his heart beating fast. What
was the matter with the boy? With a good chance
of escape before him, and half of the tunnel passed,
he ought to have been pressing forward. But here
he was, crouching almost flat to the earth, stock
still, as if afraid to advance another inch. What
could be the matter? Tom could have told you
very quickly, what he had been suspecting for the
last five minutes, and what was now true beyond
a question. <i>The passage-way was contracting!</i>
Instead of growing wider and higher it was now so
small that he could barely squeeze through on his
hands and knees. Presently he lay down at full
length, and wriggled along, the perspiration pouring
from every inch of his body, the earth falling
in a fine shower about his hair and neck. What if
the tunnel should come to an end? Should he remain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
there wedged in this terrible place, <i>buried
alive</i>? Ah, this was not all that made Tom tremble,
and urge his way still more earnestly through
the narrowing tunnel. When he had paused, a
moment before, he had heard, plainly as through a
speaking-tube, a slight disturbance, a sound of
scratching, the fall of a distant rock in the passage
behind him. He could not hide from himself the
meaning of those sounds. The Indian had explored
the cave, had discovered his method of escape, and
was now actually in the tunnel, in close pursuit.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII.<br />


<small>FOUND AT LAST.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MR. PERCIVAL had spent a busy half-day
in the open air, superintending matters
on his farm. There were early potatoes to be dug,
heavily laden branches of apple and pear trees to
be propped up, and a small, low-lying piece of
meadow-land to be mown. Slowly the deliberate
oxen had plodded to and fro, with the heavy cart
creaking and thumping behind them; while Tim
or Ruel tramped beside, urging them on with an
occasional &#8220;Haw! Ha&#8217; Bright! Gee! Star!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Percival was a good farmer, and nothing
&#8220;shiftless&#8221; could be found on his place. The barn
was always fresh and sweet, fences and walls upright;
and even the pigs seemed to enjoy a clean,
dry corner in their pen where they could lie in the
sunshine and grunt contentedly in their sleep.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the men had their work well
laid out, and the master retired for an hour or two,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
as was often his custom, to the &#8220;Den.&#8221; The little
windows, above and on the side, were wide open,
the air that floated in was cooled by the shadows
of the many-elled old house. Now and then came
the faint sounds of Tim&#8217;s encouraging shout to
his oxen, a cackle or long-drawn crow from the
poultry-yard, the bark of a dog, digging at a squirrel-hole
under the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. Percival stretched himself out comfortably
in an old cane-seat chair, having taken from its
shelf a copy of Thackeray&#8217;s &#8220;Henry Esmond,&#8221;
and began to read. As the story was perfectly
familiar to him, he opened the book in the middle,
striking into the narrative where Colonel Esmond&mdash;one
of the finest gentlemen in story&mdash;went to
the wars under gallant old General Webb.</p>

<p>The air was soft and warm, and the out-door
rustle of wind and bough so soothing, after the
hard forenoon&#8217;s work, that Mr. Percival&#8217;s fancy
began to play him queer tricks. He thought that
lovely Beatrix Esmond was nodding and smiling to
him through the little casement, and he was about
to speak to her when he returned to consciousness
with a start, laughed to himself as he saw the bit
of apple-bough, with sunlight playing on the leaves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
that had tricked him; fixed his eyes on the book
again, read six lines, and went sound asleep.</p>

<p>His dreams still followed the course of the book
he had been reading. He thought he was in England,
and that Ruel was the exiled heir to the
throne, whom it was his business to support; but
that aunt Puss persisted in wearing diamonds at
court and purring constantly (the maltese kittens
had trotted into the Den and one of them jumped
into Mr. Percival&#8217;s lap) while Ruel himself proceeded
to ride about the room on a base-ball bat,
in a manner quite inconsistent with royal dignity.
Beatrix then came on the scene, but she talked
with a brogue and confided to him, Mr. Percival,
that her real name was Bridget, and that she had a
yoke of oxen which were trained to gallop off with
a fire-engine at every alarm. In fact, the oxen
(who had been all the time eating hay behind Ruel&#8217;s
throne) now advanced, and holding a hose-pipe in
their paws&mdash;they were now very large red cats,
he noticed carelessly&mdash;began to play on the
fire.</p>

<p>The curious part of it was that the hose-pipe did
not play water at all, but cannon-balls. Indeed, it
was not hose, on closer view, but cannon, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
aunt Puss, commanding the English forces, was
firing against the French.</p>

<p><i>Boom! Boom!</i> went the cannon. The noise
of the conflict was terrible. Aunt Puss stopped
purring and rode off on one of the cats, which were
now oxen once more.</p>

<p><i>Boom! Boom! Boom!</i> It fairly shook the room&mdash;no,
the fort&mdash;that is&mdash;yes&mdash;what!&mdash;could it
be? Mr. Percival rubbed his eyes and sat upright
in his chair. Thackeray had dropped upon the
floor; a few gray hairs in his lap, and a fading sensation
of warmth in the same locality, betrayed the
recent presence of Kittie. But&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Boom! boom! boom!</i> The cannonading went on!
Now fairly awake, Mr. Percival recognized the fact
that there was an energetic pounding against the
floor directly beneath his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless me!&#8221; exclaimed the good man aloud,
jumping up and surveying the carpet suspiciously,
&#8220;what can it be?&#8221;</p>

<p>The cellar, he knew, extended under the Den.
That is, the base of the old chimney had been
there, and&mdash;ah! that long disused passage! The
little stone chamber under the arches, where one
could stifle so easily, the girls had thought! A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
muffled cry, sounding strangely like &#8220;Help!&#8221; now
accompanied the blows, which seemed lessening in
force.</p>

<p>Hesitating no longer, and dismissing from his
mind the silly ghost-stories that had been handed
down in the family, from old times, he knelt and
tore up the strip of straw matting that covered the
spot at which the blows seemed to be directed; at
the same time knocking back, in answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be some of the boys&#8217; fun,&#8221; he said to
himself, &#8220;but it won&#8217;t do to run any risks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The straw matting being removed, there appeared
a square, dimly marked out in the flooring,
by the edges of boards which had apparently been
let in, long after the neighboring portions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old trap-door!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Percival recognized the place instantly; at
the same time he was puzzled to know how to act.
For the door had long ago been removed, and these
short sections of planks nailed down in its place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in a minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>Very nimbly, for a man of his years, he hurried
out of the room, and presently returned with tools&mdash;an
axe, a large, heavy chisel, a saw, and a kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
sharp-pointed hammer, like an ice-pick. With the
aid of these, he soon had the end of one board,
then another, pried up. It must be confessed that
he was startled by the apparition that emerged
from the opening thus effected. Could that be
Tom! A face, deadly white, but streaked with
perspiration and dust, and bleeding from a bruise
on the forehead; clothes, hands, every part of him,
covered with dirt; eyes half-blinded by the sudden
light, form trembling from head to foot; it was
altogether a strange figure to come up through
uncle Will&#8217;s floor&mdash;but Tom it was, beyond a
doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;O uncle Will,&#8221; he sobbed brokenly, the tears
running over his mud-stained cheeks, &#8220;I&#8217;m so
sorry. Here&#8217;s the watch!&#8221;</p>

<p>And to Mr. Percival&#8217;s utter bewilderment, the
boy laid Pet&#8217;s little watch in his hands, safe and
whole.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was a long story, but Tom managed to tell it.
At the very first, he spoke with a shudder of the Indian,
and Mr. Percival despatched Ruel and Tim to
the woods, rightly judging that the pursuit of Tom
had ceased. The men returned within a few minutes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
and reported that Sebattis had been seen limping
away toward the road, covered with mud. He had
turned and shaken his fist at them, but on the
whole seemed more frightened than angry, and
mainly anxious to get as far away from the farm as
possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now about the watch,&#8221; said Mr. Percival
gravely, but kindly, as soon as the farm-hands had
left the room.</p>

<p>Tom hung his head still lower, but launched
manfully into his confession.</p>

<p>&#8220;I took it out of Pet&#8217;s pocket for fun,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;very soon after we started on our walk, that morning.
Then I tucked it into Kitty&#8217;s sacque, with
the chain hanging out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where Moll saw it!&#8221; exclaimed Mr. Percival,
a light breaking in on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I suppose so. After that, we came
to the Indians, and Pet fell into the pond, and I
forgot all about it. Just as I was going to bed, I
heard the girls say something about a watch being
lost, and it came to me that it was my fault. I felt
awfully about it that night, and hardly slept a bit.
Next morning I tried to get a chance to tell you
about it&mdash;do you remember, sir? but you were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
busy; and instead of <i>making</i> you hear, or owning
up at once, about my carelessness and foolish trick,
I thought I would put it off; perhaps the watch
would be found; perhaps the Indians took it, after
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why didn&#8217;t you tell me frankly, that afternoon,
my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was ashamed to; and after the trial, it was
all the harder. Then&mdash;I found the watch! It
was tucked into an old stump, near the spot where
the Indian babies, the little pappooses, had been
playing. I suppose one of them had picked it up
and hidden it there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now was the time, I know, sir, when I ought to
have told. But every minute made it harder. I
was afraid Randolph would be ashamed of me, and
the girls wouldn&#8217;t like me, and you would be angry
for all the trouble I had made, and the expense of
the sheriffs and everything. Besides,&#8221; continued
the boy eagerly, &#8220;really and truly, sir, I did mean,
every day, to give the watch back&mdash;every day.
But&mdash;somehow&mdash;it grew harder and harder, and
I didn&#8217;t. It began to seem now as if I had stolen
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a poor, miserable story of a weak boy&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
foolishness; for Tom was weak, and cowardly, too.
A little manliness at the start would have prevented
all the shame and wretchedness.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you see how he could do it? Do you
wonder how he could wish to keep the secret, for
such silly reasons?</p>

<p>Stop a moment. Are you quite sure that you
yourself would have done differently? Have you
not, even now, some little uncomfortable secret
hidden in your heart, that you had rather father or
mother would not know? If you have, let me beg
you to turn down a leaf, or put in a book-mark, at
this very page, and go this moment to those dear
hearts who are so ready to hear everything and
forgive everything with that wonderful love of
theirs which is most of anything on earth, like the
love of our Father above.</p>

<p>Tom kept nothing back, but related all his faults,
his concealments, his misgivings. At length his
narrative reached the point at which we stopped
in the last chapter, where he felt the passage narrowing,
and the Indian following behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;I made one more push,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and this
time wasn&#8217;t I glad to find that the tunnel was just
a little larger? It was like an hour-glass; and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
had passed the narrowest part, in the middle! As
soon as I was sure of this, I felt about for some
means to block the passage of the Indian. I dug
with all my might into the earth, and pretty soon
struck a good-sized rock. This almost filled the
space, and, with the loose dirt around it, I hoped
would discourage Sebattis&mdash;as I guess it did.</p>

<p>&#8220;I struck my forehead on a sharp stone and made
it bleed, though I didn&#8217;t know that till just now.
At the end of the tunnel was a little stone chamber
and a half a dozen wooden steps leading up to the
floor. These were so old that they crumbled when
I stepped on them; but I managed to climb up on
the side wall, and strike with a rock on the boards
overhead. I was afraid every moment that the
Indian might be upon me, and oh! I was so glad
when I heard your voice!&#8221;</p>

<p>What further words passed between the repentant
boy and his uncle, Tom never told. An hour
later he came out of the Den, walked up to Pet
(who had returned from her ride) with a white face
but firm step, and placing the watch and chain in
her hands, said, with trembling lips,</p>

<p>&#8220;I took it for fun, Pet, and was ashamed to
tell&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>He could get no further, and Pet, after one
glance at his face, forgave him on the spot. Nor
did she ever ask him a single question about her
lost watch.</p>

<small>QUIET DAYS AT THE PINES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHO can describe the long, peaceful days
of early autumn in the country? To our
boys and girls at uncle Will&#8217;s, the hours were full
of delight, though there were no more hair-breadth
escapes, and no fatiguing expeditions undertaken.</p>

<p>On the day after Tom&#8217;s adventure with the
Indian, Mr. Percival visited the old ledge with his
men, and placing a charge of blasting powder in
the mouth of the cave, tumbled the overhanging
rocks together in such a way that the passage was
closed forever. The boy slowly regained his cheerfulness,
and, rather shyly, took part in the pleasuring
of the rest.</p>

<p>Only two days now remained before the party
was to break up.</p>

<p>There was little time for story-telling, for the
girls were busy, packing various collections of
ferns, moss, and other memorials of their good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
times in field and forest; and their kind host was
occupied from morning till night, in overseeing
the fall work on the farm.</p>

<p>One evening, however, as they were sitting
under one of the aged elms, near the house, the
conversation turned upon mountains and mountain
climbing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you and that boy&mdash;wasn&#8217;t his name Fred?&mdash;ever
have any more adventures together?&#8221; asked
Pet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, a good many, my dear. If you&#8217;re not
too sleepy, I can tell you about a bit of a dangerous
climb I once had myself, when we two were
abroad together.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moonlight rested softly on the little circle,
and on uncle Will&#8217;s face, as he talked. Pet put
her hand in his, and begged him to go on. It was
their last story for the summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;We were both pretty well tired out, one July
evening when we reached Chamounix. Fred could
bear mountain-climbing, and, what was worse, mule-back
riding, much better than I, so that, while I
was glad to find my way to my room, in the top of
the queer old hotel, at an early hour in the evening,
Fred remained in the parlor, busily studying up
maps and guides for an excursion over the Mer de
Glace to the &#8216;Garden,&#8217; a small, fertile spot, surrounded
by eternal ice, in the very heart of the
mountains.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_208fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">QUIET MOMENTS.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;Next morning, he was off at four o&#8217;clock, leaving
me to spend the day quietly in the valley. I
was disturbed but once more before rising; this
time by a herd of goats, who scrambled along
under my windows, with bells tingling merrily
enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the course of the forenoon, I strolled away,
book in hand, following the course of the Arve for
a little while, and then striking off at right angles,
up the banks of a small brook, which joins the
larger stream just above the village.</p>

<p>&#8220;The air was soft and sweet with summer sunlight
and the breath of the silent forests, reaching
from my feet, higher and higher, until the front
rank looked on those desolate, glittering fields of
snow that crown Mount Blanc.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beside the brook the velvety turf was dotted
with wild forget-me-nots and pansies, growing there
as peacefully as if they were not in the very track
of last year&#8217;s avalanche.</p>

<p>&#8220;At length I came to a spot where the brook<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
had in ages past strewn its own path with fragments
of huge rocks, which it had loosened and
thrown down from some far-off height, where the
foot of man never trod.</p>

<p>&#8220;One gigantic bowlder lay completely across the
original bed of the stream, and rose like a wall
beside the water, that turned out of its way, and
ran off with a good-natured laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;The sun here lay warm and bright, just counteracting
the chill breeze that came from the glaciers
through the narrow gorge. I gathered a few
dry sticks, kindled a fire, merely for company, and
nestled comfortably down into an easy corner to
read the rocks, the brook, the sky, and, if there
were time left, my book, which, if I remember
rightly, was &#8216;Redgauntlet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;How long I sat there I cannot tell. It must
have been two or three hours, for it was past noon
when I looked at my watch, threw the smouldering
firebrands into the brook, and rose to return to the
hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;As I did so, I noticed half a dozen footsteps
in the steep, sandy bank that formed the side of
the ravine at this point. It suddenly occurred to
me that I had read in my guide-book, while I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
sitting in my own room, six months before, of a
certain waterfall, which, from the description, must
surely be on this brook. Yes, I recollected the
base of the zig-zag path, that we had seen as we
rode along the valley, on our way from T&ecirc;te Noire,
late the preceding afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was feeling much refreshed and rested by my
siesta, and, by a short cut up over this embankment,
I could doubtless strike that path after a
three minutes&#8217; scramble, as some one had evidently
done before me.</p>

<p>&#8220;So I would have a little adventure, and see one
of the sights of Chamounix all by myself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly there was nothing rash in this
resolve, or formidable in the undertaking; though
a certain feebleness resulting from a recent ill turn
at Geneva should have warned me against tasking
my strength too severely.</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, at it I went, laughing at the
easiness of the ascent as I followed the broad footsteps
of my predecessor. My calculation was that
I should come out on the path at a point about
seventy-five to one hundred feet above my starting-place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I had proceeded far, however, the convenient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
tracks abruptly ceased. Beyond, and on
each side, there was nothing but the gravelly bank,
with here and there a big rock ready to drop at the
lightest touch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plainly enough, the first climber had become
discouraged at this point, and had picked his way
to the bottom again. As I looked back I was
startled to observe the elevation which I had
reached, and I involuntarily crouched closer to the
earth, with a sensation as of tipping over backwards.</p>

<p>&#8220;The movement, slight as it was, dislodged a
clump of stones and sand, which went rolling and
plunging down at a great rate to the brook,
the sound of whose waters was now hardly audible.
No wonder the man had given it up! Should I go
on, or literally back down, as he had done?</p>

<p>&#8220;My pluck was stirred, and although I heartily
wished Fred was on hand with his sympathetic
courage, I resolved to complete what I had begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was tough work. Hands and knees now&mdash;and
carefully placed every time, at that. Once I
nearly lost my balance by the unexpected yielding
of a large stone, which gave way under my foot.
How fearfully long it was before I heard it smite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
on the bowlders below! I knew if I slipped, or
missed one step, the impetus of a yard would send
me after the stone. As I looked over my shoulder,
it seemed like clinging to the slope of a cathedral
roof, where a puff of wind might be fatal.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no question now as to the course I
must take. It was &#8216;Excelsior&#8217; in sober earnest&mdash;only
I didn&#8217;t have the inspiration of a maiden, with
a tear in her bright blue eye, looking on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steeper and steeper! I was panting heavily
in the rarified atmosphere, and trembling from
exhaustion. It was so terribly lonely. Nothing
but the dark forms of the trees, the waste of ice
and snow, and now and then a bird, winging its
way silently over the gulf, until my brain whirled
as I watched its slow flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;By to-morrow they would miss me, and organize
a search, with Fred at their head. They would
find my footprints beside the brook, where I had
leaped carelessly across after pansies; then they
would come upon the blackened traces of the little
fire, and the loosened gravel of the steep bank;
they would look upward with a shudder, and search
the harder. Pretty soon one of them would lean
over a crevice among the bowlders, shrink back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
with a cry of horror, and beckon to the others.
All this if I failed by one step!</p>

<p>&#8220;Still I worked on laboriously, often pausing
for giddiness or a want of breath, and digging
with my finger-nails little hollows in the hard bank
for my feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once or twice a long, tough root of grass
saved me; and soon, to my joy, straggling bushes,
strong enough to support a few pounds of weight,
thrust their tops through the sand-bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then came scrubby trees, cedar and fir, oftentimes
growing straight out from a vertical face of
rock, and quivering from root to tip as I drew myself
cautiously up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never forget the agony of the moment
when one of them came out entirely, and let me
fall backward. Fortunately its comrades were
near enough to save me, though it was with rough
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;To shorten the story, I climbed at last out upon
a small, level spot, which proved to be the longed-for
path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Following it painfully up for a few rods, I
reached a little hut, where I found a kind old
Frenchwoman, who refreshed me with food and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
drink, helped me to make my tattered clothes presentable,
and held up her hands after the demonstrative
fashion of her nation, when she heard of
my climb.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Had any one ever ascended to the cataract
upon that side?&#8217;&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;<i>Jamais, monsieur; jamais, jamais!</i>&#8217;&#8221; (Never,
monsieur; never, never.)</p>

<p>&#8220;And could she tell me the height from the
valley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mille pieds.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A thousand feet! Well, I had had mountain-climbing
enough for one day, and after a visit to
the Cascade, which was close by, I hobbled down
the easy path and back to the hotel, to read &#8216;Redgauntlet,&#8217;
until bedtime.</p>

<p>&#8220;When Fred got back, and heard the story, his
eyes were round enough, as he declared he would
not leave me behind again, to play invalid, until
we came in sight of the wharf in East Boston.
And he kept his promise.&#8221;</p>

<small>GOOD-BYE!</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE morning of the last day at The Pines
was full of sunshine. Ruel&#8217;s voice was
heard, as early as five o&#8217;clock, out by the barn.
The young folks, by a preconcerted plan, all rose
at sunrise, in order to make as long a day as possible,
and joined the men, who were milking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; said Ruel, looking up from his
foaming pail, into which the white streams were
drumming merrily, &#8220;you <i>hev</i> got up with the birds
this time, sartin!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t want to lose a minute,&#8221; answered
Kittie rather sadly. &#8220;O Ruel, I wish we could
stay till winter!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twouldn&#8217;t do,&#8221; replied the other, shaking his
head. &#8220;Thar&#8217;s plenty to do in the city, an&#8217; everybody
has his place. Sometimes I&#8217;ve wished&mdash;&#8221;
but Ruel did not say what he had wished.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruel,&#8221; said Bess, after a moment&#8217;s silence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
&#8220;why couldn&#8217;t you come to Boston in the winter
and work. Surely you could earn more money
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ruel shook his head again, more soberly than
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;My place is here with your uncle,&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;I was born and brought up in these parts. I&#8217;m
at home in the woods, an&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t bear to walk
raound on bricks an&#8217; stones. No, here I be, an&#8217;
here I must stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But wouldn&#8217;t you like to spend a month in the
city? You said the other day you had never been
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old trapper seemed at a loss for words, but
presently answered: &#8220;I can&#8217;t jest tell ye haow I
feel abaout it, Bess, but somehaow I sh&#8217;d feel shet
in, and kept away from the blue sky. What with
lookin&#8217; aout fer teams an&#8217; horses an&#8217; folks, an&#8217;
seem&#8217; all sorts o&#8217; strange sights, an&#8217; p&#8217;raps thinkin&#8217;
o&#8217; makin&#8217; money&mdash;why, I&#8217;m afeerd I shouldn&#8217;t feel
so much of a man. In the woods it&#8217;s all so still
that I can almost hear the trees a-growin&#8217;. Then a
bird flies through the baoughs overhead, an&#8217; I look
up an&#8217; see all the firs with their leetle crosses, and
the pines pointin&#8217; up, an&#8217; so I keep lookin&#8217; higher,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
an&#8217; thar&#8217;s the blue, an&#8217; the clouds, an&#8217; I remember
who&#8217;s up thar, an&#8217; who made woods an&#8217; birds an&#8217;
all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little company of daintily dressed boys and
girls felt awed into silence as they listened to this
outburst from the rough preacher, sitting on a
milking-stool, and never forgetting his work, as he
talked. It was a sermon they would remember
long after the old barn and The Pines and Ruel
himself were hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What hev ye planned fer to-day?&#8221; said Ruel
in his ordinary, quiet tones, breaking the silence
that had followed his earnest words.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, there&#8217;s a lot of packing. The &#8216;silver rags&#8217;
are to be tied up, to take home. And we&#8217;re going
to every spot on the farm where we&#8217;ve had good
times this lovely summer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinkin&#8217; that p&#8217;raps you might like to
wind up with a little fishin&#8217; trip this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O good! Where shall we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right daown by where we were cuttin&#8217; wood
last winter&mdash;remember?&mdash;thar&#8217;s a little brook
that always has plenty of trout in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s first-rate!&#8221; exclaimed Randolph. &#8220;The
girls can take a lunch&mdash;just a small one, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
much fuss&mdash;and Tom and I will furnish a string
of trout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re awful little,&#8221; added Ruel, &#8220;but they&#8217;re
sweet&#8217;s nuts. You can ketch a dozen in fifteen
minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys had been fishing several times during
their vacation, but had never taken the girls along.</p>

<p>The forenoon was full of both duty and play.
Trunks were filled to the brim and sat upon; great
bundles of birch bark were tied up and labeled.
All the cattle received toothsome bits of their
favorite varieties of food, and were bidden goodbye,
with strokings and pattings, all of which they
received with abundance of patience and long
sighs.</p>

<p>Meanwhile aunt Puss busied herself in preparing
an appetizing little lunch for the last picnic,
and for the morrow&#8217;s journey. All the men were
hard at work in the potato patch and the orchard.
At about three o&#8217;clock Ruel threw down his hoe
and informed the boys, with one of his quiet laughs,
that Mr. Percival had given him a half-day vacation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get your party together,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and meet
me in fifteen minutes out here by the pasture bars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
I&#8217;ll have the bait ready. You can bring the poles
you used last Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>With baskets for lunch and for final collections
of fresh ferns, the girls joined the rest, and all
started down the long pasture lane through which
they had watched the cattle wandering slowly
homeward so many times during the past weeks.
By special invitation the little Irish girl was included
in the party, much to her delight.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were in the shade of the
forest. The pines whispered softly to them, and
the birches, in the little clearings here and there,
fluttered their dainty leaves in the sunlight overhead.
No one felt much like talking and almost
the only sound was the occasional call of a thrush
or the piping of a locust in the tree-tops. At
length the brook was reached. The boys rigged
their fishing tackle and were soon busily creeping
down the banks of the little stream, uttering an
exclamation now and then, as they captured or lost
a lively trout.</p>

<p>The girls threw themselves down on a mossy
bank, close beside a tiny spring which Ruel pointed
out. There were fir-trees intermingled with the
pines and hemlocks around it; and on its brink a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
fringe of ferns bent over the clear water. Randolph
had known of the place before, but his cousins had
never found it.</p>

<p>When the fishermen came back, they found lunch
spread upon napkins, and awaiting only the trout.
These Ruel took in hand, dressing and broiling
them with the deftness of an old camper. Sheets
of birch bark served for plates, and the boys whittled
out knives and forks from the twigs of the
same tree. Bridget, whose first camping experience
it was, sat motionless, in a state of stupefied
wonder and delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, sir,&#8221; said Pet, addressing Randolph, &#8220;we
need one thing more. As it&#8217;s a farewell meeting,
we ought to have a poem, an original poem.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, his brother&mdash;&#8221; exclaimed Kittie.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Pet decisively, &#8220;that won&#8217;t do. We&#8217;ll
give you just twenty minutes to write one, Randolph.
If your brother can do it, of course you can.
One, two, three, begin!&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately for the boy, who was extremely confused
by the sudden request and the six bright
eyes bent upon him, he had been in the habit of
scribbling in a note book such bits of verse as occurred
to him when he was by himself; and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
very spring had suggested itself as a pretty subject
for a poem. When the time was up, accordingly,
he came forward with the following, handing it with
a low bow to Miss Pet, who read it aloud:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; cried Kittie and Bess together,
as Pet concluded, &#8220;who is Dollie? which one of us
is Dollie?&#8221; But Randolph only laughed and
wouldn&#8217;t tell.</p>

<p>With their gay spirits fully restored&mdash;for it is
as hard for boys and girls to keep solemn as for
squirrels to keep from climbing&mdash;they told stories,
laughed, talked, and raced, all the way home. Supper
over, the evening passed swiftly, and bidding
uncle Will and aunt Puss good-night, they trooped
off to their rooms for the last time. Tom and
Randolph were soon asleep, but the girls, I suspect,
stayed awake for a good while, talking over the
long, sweet summer days that were ended. At last
brown eyes and blue were closed. High above,
out of all reach of night, but shining down lovingly
into it, the stars kept watch over the old farm-house;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
and He who neither slumbers nor sleeps,
held the weary child-world in His arms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Did our young friends return home safely? Did
they see much of each other that winter in Boston?
Was Randolph successful in school; and how did
they all pass Christmas? There is no room here
for answering so many questions; but you can find
out all about them in the next number of this series,</p>
